  "abstract": "Higher-order structures, consisting of more than two individuals, provide a\nnew perspective to reveal the missed non-trivial characteristics under pairwise\nnetworks. Prior works have researched various higher-order networks, but\nresearch for evaluating the effects of higher-order structures on network\nfunctions is still scarce. In this paper, we propose a framework to quantify\nthe effects of higher-order structures (e.g., 2-simplex) and vital functions of\ncomplex networks by comparing the original network with its simplicial model.\nWe provide a simplicial model that can regulate the quantity of 2-simplices and\nsimultaneously fix the degree sequence. Although the algorithm is proposed to\ncontrol the quantity of 2-simplices, results indicate it can also indirectly\ncontrol simplexes more than 2-order. Experiments on spreading dynamics, pinning\ncontrol, network robustness, and community detection have shown that regulating\nthe quantity of 2-simplices changes network performance significantly. In\nconclusion, the proposed framework is a general and effective tool for linking\nhigher-order structures with network functions. It can be regarded as a\nreference object in other applications and can deepen our understanding of the\ncorrelation between micro-level network structures and global network\nfunctions.",
