  "abstract": "Asynchronous time series, also known as temporal event sequences, are the\nbasis of many applications throughout different industries. Temporal point\nprocesses(TPPs) are the standard method for modeling such data. Existing TPP\nmodels have focused on parameterizing the conditional distribution of future\nevents instead of explicitly modeling event interactions, imposing challenges\nfor event predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that\nleverages Neural Relational Inference (NRI) to learn a relation graph that\ninfers interactions while simultaneously learning the dynamics patterns from\nobservational data. Our approach, the Contrastive Relational Inference-based\nHawkes Process (CRIHP), reasons about event interactions under a variational\ninference framework. It utilizes intensity-based learning to search for\nprototype paths to contrast relationship constraints. Extensive experiments on\nthree real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in\ncapturing event interactions for event sequence modeling tasks. Code will be\nintegrated into the EasyTPP framework.",
