  "abstract": "We develop a consistent approach to calculate the moment of inertia (MOI) for\naxisymmetric neutron stars (NSs) in the Lorentz-violating Standard-Model\nExtension (SME) framework. To our knowledge, this is the first relativistic MOI\ncalculation for axisymmetric NSs in a Lorentz-violating gravity theory other\nthan deformed, rotating NSs in the General Relativity. Under Lorentz violation,\nthere is a specific direction in the spacetime and NSs get stretched or\ncompressed along that direction. When a NS is spinning stationarily along this\ndirection, a conserved angular momentum and the concept of MOI are well\ndefined. In the SME framework, we calculate the partial differential equation\ngoverning the rotation and solve it numerically with the finite element method\nto get the MOI for axisymmetric NSs caused by Lorentz violation. Besides, we\nstudy an approximate case where the correction to the MOI is regarded solely\nfrom the deformation of the NS and compare it with its counterpart in the\nNewtonian gravity. Our formalism and the numerical method can be extended to\nother theories of gravity for static axisymmetric NSs.",
