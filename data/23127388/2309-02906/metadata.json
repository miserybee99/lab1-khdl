  "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a class of McKean-Vlasov stochastic\ndifferential equations under L\\'evy-type perturbations. We first establish the\nexistence and uniqueness theorem for solutions of the McKean-Vlasov stochastic\ndifferential equations by utilizing the Euler-like approximation. Then under\nsome suitable conditions, we show that the solutions of McKean-Vlasov\nstochastic differential equations can be approximated by the solutions of the\nassociated averaged McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations in the\nsense of mean square convergence. In contrast to the existing work, a novel\nfeature is the use of a much weaker condition -- local Lipschitzian in the\nstate variables, allowing for possibly super-linearly growing drift, but\nlinearly growing diffusion and jump coefficients. Therefore, our results are\nsuitable for a wider class of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations.",
