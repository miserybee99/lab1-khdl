For the implementation details, we use several packages with a python 3.8 version.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We use PyTorch~\cite{pytorch} for all deep learning models and automatic differentiation, as well as NumPy~\cite{numpy} for arrays handling.
    \item We use Python Optimal Transport's function \verb+emd2+\cite{flamary_pot_2021} to compute the Wasserstein distances between weighted sums of Diracs.
    \item We used the implementation of SIMCLR from PyTorch Lightning~\cite{pytorch_lightning}.
    \item Small datasets such as isotropic Gaussian Mixture of score computations are performed using scikit-learn\cite{scikit-learn}.
\end{itemize}
