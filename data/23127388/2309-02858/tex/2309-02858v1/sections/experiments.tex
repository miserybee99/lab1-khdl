For all experiments below, we report the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)~\cite{hubert_comparing_1985}, a common metric in clustering. This metric is external as it requires labels for evaluation. It ranges from 0, when labels are independent from cluster assignments, to 1, when labels are equivalent to cluster assignments up to permutations. An ARI close to 0 is equivalent to the best accuracy when voting constantly for the majority class, e.g. 10\% on a balanced 10-class dataset. Regarding the MMD- and Wasserstein-GEMINIs, we used by default a linear kernel and the Euclidean distance unless specified otherwise. All discriminative models are trained using the Adam optimiser~\cite{kingma_adam_2014}. We estimate a total of 450 hours of GPU consumption. (See Appendix~\ref{app:requirements} for the details of python packages for experiments).
