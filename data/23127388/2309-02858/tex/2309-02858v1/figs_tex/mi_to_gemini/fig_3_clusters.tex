\caption{Here, 3 clusters of equal proportions from isotropic Gaussian distributions are located in -2, 0 and 2 on the x-axis, with small covariance. The complete data distribution hence has its expectation in 0 on the x-axis. Consequently, maximising the OvA MMD-GEMINI with a logistic regression led to 2 clusters whereas the same model with the OvO MMD-GEMINI is able to see all 3 clusters.}\label{fig:example_ova_ovo}
