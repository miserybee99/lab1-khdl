  "abstract": "Image aesthetics assessment (IAA) aims to estimate the aesthetics of images.\nDepending on the content of an image, diverse criteria need to be selected to\nassess its aesthetics. Existing works utilize pre-trained vision backbones\nbased on content knowledge to learn image aesthetics. However, training those\nbackbones is time-consuming and suffers from attention dispersion. Inspired by\nlearnable queries in vision-language alignment, we propose the Image Aesthetics\nAssessment via Learnable Queries (IAA-LQ) approach. It adapts learnable queries\nto extract aesthetic features from pre-trained image features obtained from a\nfrozen image encoder. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the\nadvantages of IAA-LQ, beating the best state-of-the-art method by 2.2% and 2.1%\nin terms of SRCC and PLCC, respectively.",
