  "abstract": "In the present paper, we study the shifted hypergeometric function\n$f(z)=z\\Gauss(a,b;c;z)$ for real parameters with $0<a\\le b\\le c$ and its\nvariant $g(z)=z\\Gauss(a,b;c;z^2).$ Our first purpose is to solve the range\nproblems for $f$ and $g$ posed by Ponnusamy and Vuorinen in their 2001 paper.\nRuscheweyh, Salinas and Sugawa developed in their 2009 paper the theory of\nuniversal prestarlike functions on the slit domain $\\C\\setminus[1,+\\infty)$ and\nshowed universal starlikeness of $f$ under some assumptions on the parameters.\nHowever, there has been no systematic study of universal convexity of the\nshifted hypergeometric functions except for the case $b=1.$ Our second purpose\nis to show universal convexity of $f$ under certain conditions on the\nparameters.",
