  "abstract": "Quantum dots have the potential to be the brightest deterministic single\nphoton source with plausible high end applications in quantum computing and\ncluster state generation. In this work, we re-examine the design of simple\nmicropillars by meticulously examining the structural effects of the decay into\nleaky channels beyond the atom-like cavity estimation. We show that precise\ncontrol of the side losses with the diameter and avoidance of propagating Bloch\nmodes in the DBR structure can result in easy to manufacture broadband\n(Q$\\approx750-2500$) micropillars and demonstrate extremely high internal\nefficiency ($90.5\\%-96.4\\%$). We also demonstrate that such cavities naturally\ndecouple from the phonon sideband, with the phonon sideband reducing by a\nfactor of $5-33$ allowing us to predict that the photons should show\n$99.2\\%-99.8\\%$ indistinguishability.",
