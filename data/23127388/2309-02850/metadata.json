  "abstract": "The problem of the transition of electron shells of atoms to excited states\nin the process of neutrinoless double-$\\beta$ decay is investigated. This\nsubject is crucial for modeling the energy spectrum of $\\beta$-electrons, which\nis sensitive to the mass and Majorana nature of neutrinos. The dependence of\nthe obtained results on the atomic number indicates the determining role of the\nFeinberg--Migdal effect in the electron shell excitations. We report the\noverlap amplitudes of the electron shells of the parent atom and the daughter\nion for eleven atoms, the two-neutrino double-$\\beta$ decay of which was\nobserved experimentally. In around one-fourth of the cases where the structure\nof the electron shells is inherited from the parent atom, there is a transition\nto the ground state or the excited state with the lowest energy. The\nde-excitation of the daughter ion in the latter scenario is accompanied by the\nemission of photons in the ultraviolet range, which can serve as an auxiliary\nsignature of double-$\\beta$ decay. The average excitation energy of the\nelectron shells ranges between 300 and 800 eV, with the variance ranging from\n$(1.7~\\mathrm{keV})^2$ in calcium to $(14~\\mathrm{keV})^2$ in uranium.",
