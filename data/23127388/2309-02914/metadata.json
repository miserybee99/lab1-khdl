  "abstract": "Geographical location is a crucial element of humanitarian response,\noutlining vulnerable populations, ongoing events, and available resources.\nLatest developments in Natural Language Processing may help in extracting vital\ninformation from the deluge of reports and documents produced by the\nhumanitarian sector. However, the performance and biases of existing\nstate-of-the-art information extraction tools are unknown. In this work, we\ndevelop annotated resources to fine-tune the popular Named Entity Recognition\n(NER) tools Spacy and roBERTa to perform geotagging of humanitarian texts. We\nthen propose a geocoding method FeatureRank which links the candidate locations\nto the GeoNames database. We find that not only does the humanitarian-domain\ndata improves the performance of the classifiers (up to F1 = 0.92), but it also\nalleviates some of the bias of the existing tools, which erroneously favor\nlocations in the Western countries. Thus, we conclude that more resources from\nnon-Western documents are necessary to ensure that off-the-shelf NER systems\nare suitable for the deployment in the humanitarian sector.",
