  "abstract": "We theoretically and numerically investigate the spin fluctuations induced in\na thermal atomic ensemble by an external fluctuating uniaxial magnetic field,\nin the context of a standard spin noise spectroscopy (SNS) experiment. We show\nthat additional spin noise is excited, which dramatically depends on the\nmagnetic noise variance and bandwidth, as well as on the power of the probe\nlight and its polarization direction. We develop an analytical perturbative\nmodel proving that this spin noise first emerges from the residual optical\npumping in the medium, which is then converted into spin fluctuations by the\nmagnetic noise and eventually detected using SNS. The system studied is a\nspin-1 system, which thus shows both Faraday rotation and ellipticity noises\ninduced by the random magnetic fluctuations. The analytical model gives results\nin perfect agreement with the numerical simulations, with potential\napplications in future experimental characterization of stray field properties\nand their influence on spin dynamics.",
