  "abstract": "We study higher dimensional charged Kerr-Schild (KS) spacetimes that can be\nconstructed by a KS transformation of a vacuum solution with an arbitrary\ncosmological constant, and for which the vector potential is aligned with the\nKS vector $\\mathbf{k}$. Focusing on the case of an expanding $\\mathbf{k}$, we\nfirst characterize the presence of shear as an obstruction to non-null fields\n(thereby extending an early no-go result of Myers and Perry). We next obtain\nthe complete family of shearfree solutions. In the twistfree case, they\ncoincide with charged Schwarzschild-Tangherlini-like black holes. Solutions\nwith a twisting $\\mathbf{k}$ consist of a four-parameter family of higher\ndimensional charged Taub-NUT metrics with a base space of constant holomorphic\nsectional curvature. In passing, we identify the configurations for which the\ntest-field limit gives rise to instances of the KS double copy. Finally, it is\nshown that null fields define a branch of twistfree but shearing solutions,\nexemplified by the product of a Vaidya-like radiating spacetime with an extra\ndimension.",
