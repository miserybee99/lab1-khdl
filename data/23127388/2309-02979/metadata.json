  "abstract": "Social Robots in human environments need to be able to reason about their\nphysical surroundings while interacting with people. Furthermore, human\nproxemics behaviours around robots can indicate how people perceive the robots\nand can inform robot personality and interaction design. Here, we introduce\nCharlie, a situated robot receptionist that can interact with people using\nverbal and non-verbal communication in a dynamic environment, where users might\nenter or leave the scene at any time. The robot receptionist is stationary and\ncannot navigate. Therefore, people have full control over their personal space\nas they are the ones approaching the robot. We investigated the influence of\ndifferent apparent robot personalities on the proxemics behaviours of the\nhumans. The results indicate that different types of robot personalities,\nspecifically introversion and extroversion, can influence human proxemics\nbehaviours. Participants maintained shorter distances with the introvert robot\nreceptionist, compared to the extrovert robot. Interestingly, we observed that\nhuman-robot proxemics were not the same as typical human-human interpersonal\ndistances, as defined in the literature. We therefore propose new proxemics\nzones for human-robot interaction.",
