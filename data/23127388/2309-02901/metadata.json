  "abstract": "Pipelined analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are key enablers in many\nstate-of-the-art signal processing systems with high sampling rates. In\naddition to high sampling rates, such systems often demand a high linearity. To\nmeet these challenging linearity requirements, ADC calibration techniques were\nheavily investigated throughout the past decades. One limitation in ADC\ncalibration is the need for a precisely known test signal. In our previous\nwork, we proposed the homogeneity enforced calibration (HEC) approach, which\ncircumvents this need by consecutively feeding a test signal and a scaled\nversion of it into the ADC. The calibration itself is performed using only the\ncorresponding output samples, such that the test signal can remain unknown. On\nthe downside, the HEC approach requires to accurately scale the test signal,\nimpeding an on-chip implementation. In this work, we provide a thorough\nanalysis of the HEC approach, including limitations such as the effects of an\ninaccurately scaled test signal. Furthermore, the bi-linear homogeneity\nenforced calibration (BL-HEC) approach is introduced and suggested to account\nfor an inaccurate scaling and, therefore, to facilitate an on-chip\nimplementation. In addition, a comprehensive stability analysis of the BL-HEC\napproach is carried out. Finally, we verify our concept with behavioral Matlab\nsimulations and measurements conducted on 24 integrated ADCs.",
