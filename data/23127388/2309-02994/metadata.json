  "abstract": "We consider an offline learning problem for an agent who first estimates an\nunknown price impact kernel from a static dataset, and then designs strategies\nto liquidate a risky asset while creating transient price impact. We propose a\nnovel approach for a nonparametric estimation of the propagator from a dataset\ncontaining correlated price trajectories, trading signals and metaorders. We\nquantify the accuracy of the estimated propagator using a metric which depends\nexplicitly on the dataset. We show that a trader who tries to minimise her\nexecution costs by using a greedy strategy purely based on the estimated\npropagator will encounter suboptimality due to so-called spurious correlation\nbetween the trading strategy and the estimator and due to intrinsic uncertainty\nresulting from a biased cost functional. By adopting an offline reinforcement\nlearning approach, we introduce a pessimistic loss functional taking the\nuncertainty of the estimated propagator into account, with an optimiser which\neliminates the spurious correlation, and derive an asymptotically optimal bound\non the execution costs even without precise information on the true propagator.\nNumerical experiments are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed propagator estimator and the pessimistic trading strategy.",
