  "abstract": "Online health communities (OHCs) are forums where patients with similar\nconditions communicate their experiences and provide moral support. Social\nsupport in OHCs plays a crucial role in easing and rehabilitating patients.\nHowever, many time-sensitive questions from patients often remain unanswered\ndue to the multitude of threads and the random nature of patient visits in\nOHCs. To address this issue, it is imperative to propose a recommender system\nthat assists solution seekers in finding appropriate problem helpers.\nNevertheless, developing a recommendation algorithm to enhance social support\nin OHCs remains an under-explored area. Traditional recommender systems cannot\nbe directly adapted due to the following obstacles. First, unlike user-item\nlinks in traditional recommender systems, it is hard to model the social\nsupport behind helper-seeker links in OHCs since they are formed based on\nvarious heterogeneous reasons. Second, it is difficult to distinguish the\nimpact of historical activities in characterizing patients. Third, it is\nsignificantly challenging to ensure that the recommended helpers possess\nsufficient expertise to assist the seekers. To tackle the aforementioned\nchallenges, we develop a Monotonically regularIzed diseNTangled Variational\nAutoencoders (MINT) model to strengthen social support in OHCs.",
