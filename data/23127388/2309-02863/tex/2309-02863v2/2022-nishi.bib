Using a programmable quantum simulator based on neutral atom arrays with interactions mediated by Rydberg states, we demonstrate the creation of “Schrödinger cat” states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to 20 qubits. Our approach is based on engineering the energy spectrum and using optimal control of the many-body system. We further demonstrate entanglement manipulation by using GHZ states to distribute entanglement to distant sites in the array, establishing important ingredients for quantum information processing and quantum metrology.},

The number of experimental settings required to extract complete information about a device grows exponentially with its size, and so does the running time for processing the data generated by these experiments. Part of the problem is that tomography generates much more information than is usually sought. Taking a more targeted approach, we develop schemes that enable (i) estimating the fidelity of an experiment to a theoretical ideal description, (ii) learning which description within a reduced subset best matches the experimental data. Both these approaches yield a significant reduction in resources compared to tomography. In particular, we demonstrate that fidelity can be estimated from a number of simple experimental settings that is independent of the system size, removing an important roadblock for the experimental study of larger quantum information processing units.},

There is a plethora of techniques that reveal entanglement on the basis of only partial information about the underlying quantum state including, in particular, entanglement witnesses. Superradiance refers to the phenomenon of highly synchronized photon emission from an ensemble of quantum emitters that is caused by correlations among the individual particles and has been connected by Dicke himself to the presence of multipartite entangled states. We investigate this connection in a quantitative way and discuss, whether or not signatures of superradiance from semiconductor nanolasers, manifesting themselves as a modification of the spontaneous-emission time, can be interpreted as a witness to detect entanglement in the underlying state of the emitters.},

	abstract = {We reduce the extra qubits needed for two fault-tolerant quantum computing protocols: error correction, specifically syndrome bit measurement, and cat state preparation. For distance-three fault-tolerant syndrome extraction, we show an exponential reduction in qubit overhead over the previous best protocol. For a weight-\$w\$ stabilizer, we demonstrate that stabilizer measurement tolerating one fault needs at most \${\textbackslash}lceil {\textbackslash}log\_2 w {\textbackslash}rceil + 1\$ ancilla qubits. If qubits reset quickly, four ancillas suffice. We also study the preparation of entangled cat states, and prove that the overhead for distance-three fault tolerance is logarithmic in the cat state size. These results apply both to near-term experiments with a few qubits, and to the general study of the asymptotic resource requirements of syndrome measurement and state preparation. With \$a\$ flag qubits, previous methods use \$O(a)\$ flag patterns to identify faults. In order to use the same flag qubits more efficiently, we show how to use nearly all \$2{\textasciicircum}a\$ possible flag patterns, by constructing maximal-length paths through the \$a\$-dimensional hypercube.},

A common approach to certify GME is to prepare a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state and measure a GHZ fidelity of at least 0.5. We measure the fidelities using multiple quantum coherences of GHZ states on 11 to 27 qubits prepared on the IBM Quantum ibmq\_montreal device. Combinations of quantum readout error mitigation (QREM) and parity verification error detection are applied to the states. A fidelity of \$0.546 {\textbackslash}pm 0.017\$ was recorded for a 27-qubit GHZ state when QREM was used, demonstrating GME across the full device with a confidence level of 98.6\%. We benchmarked the effect of parity verification on GHZ fidelity for two GHZ state preparation embeddings on the heavy-hexagon architecture. The results show that the effect of parity verification, while relatively modest, led to a detectable improvement of GHZ fidelity.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2303.02499},
	abstract = {Silicon/silicon-germanium heterostructures have many important advantages for hosting spin qubits. However, controlling the energy splitting between the two low-energy conduction-band valleys remains a critical challenge for scaling up to large numbers of reliable qubits. Broad distributions of valley splittings are commonplace, even among quantum dots formed on the same chip. Such behavior has previously been attributed to imperfections such as steps at the quantum well interface. The most common approaches for addressing this problem have sought to engineer design improvements into the quantum well. In this work, we develop a simple, universal theory of valley splitting based on the reciprocal-space profile of the quantum well confinement potential, which simultaneously explains the effects of steps, wide interfaces, alloy disorder, and custom heterostructure designs. We use this understanding to characterize theoretically the valley splitting in a variety of heterostructures, finding that alloy disorder can explain the observed variability of the valley splitting, even in the absence of steps. Moreover we show that steps have a significant effect on the valley splitting only when the top interface is very sharp. We predict a universal crossover from a regime where low valley splittings are rare to a regime dominated by alloy disorder, in which valley splittings can approach zero. We show that many recent experiments fall into the latter category, with important implications for large-scale qubit implementations. We finally propose a strategy to suppress the incidence of low valley splittings by (i) increasing the random alloy disorder (to increase the valley splitting variance), and then (ii) allowing for electrostatic tuning of the dot position (to access locations with higher valley splitting).},

	abstract = {Stable entangling operations between qubits are essential for the efficient performance of multi-qubit systems and will be a crucial factor in avoiding errors in full-scale quantum processors. Recent demonstrations on a number of different silicon spin qubit platforms have indicated promising two-qubit gate fidelities at the threshold required for quantum error correction, with errors below around one percent, however, further understanding of the stability of such fidelities is required to assess the true prospects for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here we demonstrate the first operation of two-qubit gates with fidelities above 99\% in the technologically important silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) quantum dot platform. We undertake a detailed study of the stability of two-qubit operations in silicon, as required for scalable quantum computing, by analyzing errors and fidelities in multiple devices through numerous trials and Extended periods of operation. Our characterisation methods indicate fidelities ranging from 96.8\% to 99.8\% , putting these qubits at the threshold required for error correction. Our analysis tools also identify physical causes of qubit degradation and offer ways to maintain performance within tolerance. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of qubit design, feedback systems, and robust gates on implementing scalable, high-fidelity control strategies. These results highlight both the capabilities and challenges for the scaling up of spin-based qubits into full-scale quantum processors.},

	abstract = {We present measurements and simulations of semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure devices that are consistent with the observation of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes. The devices are fabricated from high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in which quasi-one-dimensional wires are defined by electrostatic gates. These devices enable measurements of local and non-local transport properties and have been optimized via extensive simulations to ensure robustness against non-uniformity and disorder. Our main result is that several devices, fabricated according to the design's engineering specifications, have passed the topological gap protocol defined in Pikulin {\textbackslash}textit\{et al.\} [arXiv:2103.12217]. This protocol is a stringent test composed of a sequence of three-terminal local and non-local transport measurements performed while varying the magnetic field, semiconductor electron density, and junction transparencies. Passing the protocol indicates a high probability of detection of a topological phase hosting Majorana zero modes as determined by large-scale disorder simulations. Our experimental results are consistent with a quantum phase transition into a topological superconducting phase that extends over several hundred millitesla in magnetic field and several millivolts in gate voltage, corresponding to approximately one hundred micro-electron-volts in Zeeman energy and chemical potential in the semiconducting wire. These regions feature a closing and re-opening of the bulk gap, with simultaneous zero-bias conductance peaks at {\textbackslash}textit\{both\} ends of the devices that withstand changes in the junction transparencies. The extracted maximum topological gaps in our devices are 20-\$60{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu\$eV. This demonstration is a prerequisite for experiments involving fusion and braiding of Majorana zero modes.},

Motivated by an interest in deterministic circuits with similar applications, we construct classes of {\textbackslash}textit\{nonrandom\} unitary Clifford circuits by imposing translation invariance in both time and space. Further imposing dual-unitarity, our circuits effectively become crystalline spacetime lattices whose vertices are SWAP or iSWAP two-qubit gates and whose edges may contain one-qubit gates. One can then require invariance under (subgroups of) the crystal's point group. Working on the square and kagome lattices, we use the formalism of Clifford quantum cellular automata to describe operator spreading, entanglement generation, and recurrence times of these circuits. A full classification on the square lattice reveals, of particular interest, a "non-fractal good scrambling class" with dense operator spreading that generates codes with linear contiguous code distance and high performance under erasure errors at the end of the circuit. We also break unitarity by adding spacetime-translation-invariant measurements and find a class of such circuits with fractal dynamics.},

In addition to the intuitive tendency to bring the system into a topologically trivial and localized phase, it has been discovered that disorder can also induce nontrivial topology and transport. To reveal rich and diverse phase structures, mapping phase diagrams plays an important role in both theoretical and experimental sides. Quantum simulation provides a prospective way to study the target model, explore the phase diagram and reveal the underlying mechanism. Thanks to the unprecedented controllability, superconducting quantum simulators have been introduced to investigate complex many-body physics and bring thought experiments into reality. To our best knowledge, the effort to map a phase diagram with a rich structure is still lacking. Here we report a systematic experimental study of the topology-disorder phase diagram with 32 qubits on a programmable analog quantum simulator. We implement one-dimensional (1D) disordered dimerized tight-binding models over a wide parameter range and observe diverse phases, including the topological Anderson insulator (TAI) and the inverse Anderson localization (IAL). Our experiment manifests the efficiency, accuracy and flexibility of the superconducting-circuit device and paves the way to the demonstration and understanding of many-body phenomena with noisy intermediate-scale quantum simulators.},

Specifically, we report constant-cost implementations of Clifford operations with and without ancillae, constant-cost implementation of the multiply-controlled gates with linearly many ancillae, and an O(log∗(n)) cost implementation of the n-controlled single-target gates using logarithmically many ancillae.

Here we show that the celebrated \${\textbackslash}sin{\textbackslash}varphi\$ current-phase relation (C\${\textbackslash}varphi\$R) of Josephson junctions (JJs) fails to fully describe the energy spectra of transmon artificial atoms across various samples and laboratories. While the microscopic theory of JJs contains higher harmonics in the C\${\textbackslash}varphi\$R, these have generally been assumed to give insignificant corrections for tunnel JJs, due to the low transparency of the conduction channels. However, this assumption might not be justified given the disordered nature of the commonly used AlO\$\_x\$ tunnel barriers. Indeed, a mesoscopic model of tunneling through an inhomogeneous AlO\$\_x\$ barrier predicts contributions from higher Josephson harmonics of several \%. By including these in the transmon Hamiltonian, we obtain orders of magnitude better agreement between the computed and measured energy spectra. The measurement of Josephson harmonics in the C\${\textbackslash}varphi\$R of standard tunnel junctions prompts a reevaluation of current models for superconducting hardware and it offers a highly sensitive probe towards optimizing tunnel barrier uniformity.},

	abstract = {This survey reviews works in which language models (LMs) are augmented with reasoning skills and the ability to use tools. The former is defined as decomposing a potentially complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists in calling external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs can leverage these augmentations separately or in combination via heuristics, or learn to do so from demonstrations. While adhering to a standard missing tokens prediction objective, such augmented LMs can use various, possibly non-parametric external modules to expand their context processing ability, thus departing from the pure language modeling paradigm. We therefore refer to them as Augmented Language Models (ALMs). The missing token objective allows ALMs to learn to reason, use tools, and even act, while still performing standard natural language tasks and even outperforming most regular LMs on several benchmarks. In this work, after reviewing current advance in ALMs, we conclude that this new research direction has the potential to address common limitations of traditional LMs such as interpretability, consistency, and scalability issues.},

Our technique performs shadow tomography on a logical state to produce a memory-efficient classical reconstruction of the noisy density matrix. Using efficient classical post-processing, one can mitigate errors by projecting a general nonlinear function of the noisy density matrix into the codespace. The subspace expansion and virtual distillation can be viewed as special cases of the new framekwork. We show our method is favorable in the quantum and classical resources overhead. Relative to subspace expansion which requires \$O{\textbackslash}left(2{\textasciicircum}\{N\} {\textbackslash}right)\$ samples to estimate a logical Pauli observable with \$[[N, k]]\$ error correction code, our technique requires only \$O{\textbackslash}left(4{\textasciicircum}\{k\} {\textbackslash}right)\$ samples. Relative to virtual distillation, our technique can compute powers of the density matrix without additional copies of quantum states or quantum memory. We present numerical evidence using logical states encoded with up to sixty physical qubits and show fast convergence to error-free expectation values with only \$10{\textasciicircum}5\$ samples under 1\% depolarizing noise.},

	abstract = {Physical constraints make it challenging to implement and control many-body interactions. For this reason, designing quantum information processes with Hamiltonians consisting of only one- and two-local terms is a worthwhile challenge. Enabling error suppression with two-local Hamiltonians is particularly challenging. A no-go theorem of Marvian and Lidar (Phys Rev Lett 113(26):260504, 2014) demonstrates that, even allowing particles with high Hilbert space dimension, it is impossible to protect quantum information from single-site errors by encoding in the ground subspace of any Hamiltonian containing only commuting two-local terms. Here, we get around this no-go result by encoding in the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian consisting of non-commuting two-local terms arising from the gauge operators of a subsystem code. Specifically, we show how to protect stored quantum information against single-qubit errors using a Hamiltonian consisting of sums of the gauge generators from Bacon–Shor codes (Bacon in Phys Rev A 73(1):012340, 2006) and generalized-Bacon–Shor code (Bravyi in Phys Rev A 83(1):012320, 2011). Our results imply that non-commuting two-local Hamiltonians have more error-suppressing power than commuting two-local Hamiltonians. While far from providing full fault tolerance, this approach improves the robustness achievable in near-term implementable quantum storage and adiabatic quantum computations, reducing the number of higher-order terms required to encode commonly used adiabatic Hamiltonians such as the Ising Hamiltonians common in adiabatic quantum optimization and quantum annealing.},

All these constructions use no additional entangling gate layers and display essentially the same logical performance, having teraquop footprints within 25\% of the standard surface code circuit.

In this work, we use mid-circuit measurement and feed-forward to implement deterministic non-unitary dynamics on Quantinuum's H1 programmable ion-trap quantum computer. Enabled by these capabilities, we demonstrate for the first time a constant-depth procedure for creating a toric code ground state in real-time. In addition to reaching high stabilizer fidelities, we create a non-Abelian defect whose presence is confirmed by transmuting anyons via braiding.

In addition to being crucial for quantum error correction, this capability can help reduce the number of qubits needed to execute many types of quantum algorithms by measuring qubits as early as possible, resetting them, and reusing them elsewhere in the circuit. In this work, we introduce the idea of qubit-reuse compilation, which takes as input a quantum circuit and produces as output a compiled circuit that requires fewer qubits to execute due to qubit reuse. We present two algorithms for performing qubit-reuse compilation: an exact constraint programming optimization model and a greedy heuristic. We introduce the concept of dual circuits, obtained by exchanging state preparations with measurements and vice versa and reversing time, and show that optimal qubit-reuse compilation requires the same number of qubits to execute a circuit as its dual. We illustrate the performance of these algorithms on a variety of relevant near-term quantum circuits, such as one-dimensional and two-dimensional time-evolution circuits, and numerically benchmark their performance on the quantum adiabatic optimization algorithm (QAOA) applied to the MaxCut problem on random three-regular graphs. To demonstrate the practical benefit of these techniques, we experimentally realize an 80-qubit QAOA MaxCut circuit on the 20-qubit Quantinuum H1-1 trapped ion quantum processor using qubit-reuse compilation algorithms.},

Such thresholds are usually determined based on the success of decoding algorithms rather than the intrinsic properties of the mixed states describing corrupted memories. Here we provide an intrinsic characterization of the breakdown of topological quantum memory, which both gives a bound on the performance of decoding algorithms and provides examples of topologically distinct mixed states. We employ three information-theoretical quantities that can be regarded as generalizations of the diagnostics of ground-state topological order, and serve as a definition for topological order in error-corrupted mixed states. We consider the topological contribution to entanglement negativity and two other metrics based on quantum relative entropy and coherent information. In the concrete example of the 2D Toric code with local bit-flip and phase errors, we map three quantities to observables in 2D classical spin models and analytically show they all undergo a transition at the same error threshold. This threshold is an upper bound on that achieved in any decoding algorithm and is indeed saturated by that in the optimal decoding algorithm for the Toric code.},

This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.},

A large class of topological orders, including chiral topological order, can be prepared in constant depth or time, and one-dimensional CFT states and non-abelian topological orders with both solvable and non-solvable groups can be prepared in depth scaling logarithmically with system size.

This establishes a connection between multipartite entanglement and many-body correlations contained in response functions, with immediate implications close to quantum phase transitions, where the quantum Fisher information becomes universal, allowing us to identify strongly entangled phase transitions with a divergent multipartite entanglement.

	abstract = {The ground state of the spin-1 Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb and Tasaki (AKLT) model is a paradigmatic example of both a matrix product state and a symmetry-protected topological phase, and additionally holds promise as a resource state for measurement-based quantum computation. Having a nonzero correlation length, the AKLT state cannot be exactly prepared by a constant-depth unitary circuit composed of local gates. In this work, we demonstrate that this no-go limit can be evaded by augmenting a constant-depth circuit with fusion measurements, such that the total preparation time is independent of system size and entirely deterministic. We elucidate our preparation scheme using the language of tensor networks, and furthermore show that the \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2{\textbackslash}times{\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ symmetry of the AKLT state directly affords this speed-up over previously known preparation methods. To demonstrate the practical advantage of measurement-assisted preparation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, we carry out our protocol on an IBM Quantum processor. We measure both the string order and entanglement spectrum of prepared AKLT chains and, employing these as metrics, find improved results over the known (purely unitary) sequential preparation approach. We conclude with a demonstration of quantum teleportation using the AKLT state prepared by our measurement-assisted scheme. This work thus serves to provide an efficient strategy to prepare a specific resource in the form of the AKLT state and, more broadly, experimentally demonstrates the possibility for realizable improvement in state preparation afforded by measurement-based circuit depth reduction strategies on NISQ-era devices.},

This establishes a connection between multipartite entanglement and many-body correlations contained in response functions, with immediate implications close to quantum phase transitions, where the quantum Fisher information becomes universal, allowing us to identify strongly entangled phase transitions with a divergent multipartite entanglement.

The complexity of large quantum systems is the source of computational power but also makes them difficult to control precisely or characterize accurately using measured classical data. We review protocols for probing the properties of complex many-qubit systems using measurement schemes that are practical using today’s quantum platforms. In these protocols, a quantum state is repeatedly prepared and measured in a randomly chosen basis; then a classical computer processes the measurement outcomes to estimate the desired property. The randomization of the measurement procedure has distinct advantages. For example, a single data set can be used multiple times to pursue a variety of applications, and imperfections in the measurements are mapped to a simplified noise model that can more easily be mitigated. We discuss a range of cases that have already been realized in quantum devices, including Hamiltonian simulation tasks, probes of quantum chaos, measurements of non-local order parameters, and comparison of quantum states produced in distantly separated laboratories. By providing a workable method for translating a complex quantum state into a succinct classical representation that preserves a rich variety of relevant physical properties, the randomized measurement toolbox strengthens our ability to grasp and control the quantum world.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing promises to offer substantial speed-ups over its classical counterpart for certain problems. However, the greatest impediment to realizing its full potential is noise that is inherent to these systems. The widely accepted solution to this challenge is the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits, which is out of reach for current processors. Here we report experiments on a noisy 127-qubit processor and demonstrate the measurement of accurate expectation values for circuit volumes at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. We argue that this represents evidence for the utility of quantum computing in a pre-fault-tolerant era. These experimental results are enabled by advances in the coherence and calibration of a superconducting processor at this scale and the ability to characterize1 and controllably manipulate noise across such a large device. We establish the accuracy of the measured expectation values by comparing them with the output of exactly verifiable circuits. In the regime of strong entanglement, the quantum computer provides correct results for which leading classical approximations such as pure-state-based 1D (matrix product states, MPS) and 2D (isometric tensor network states, isoTNS) tensor network methods2,3 break down. These experiments demonstrate a foundational tool for the realization of near-term quantum applications4,5.},

Here we propose a decoder for the surface code that finds low-weight correction operators for errors produced by the depolarising noise model. The decoder is obtained by mapping the syndrome of the surface code onto that of the color code, thereby allowing us to adopt more sophisticated color-code decoding algorithms. Analytical arguments and exhaustive testing show that the resulting decoder can find a least-weight correction for all weight \$d/2\$ depolarising errors for even code distance \$d\$. This improves the logical error rate by an exponential factor \$O(2{\textasciicircum}\{d/2\})\$ compared with decoders that treat bit-flip and dephasing errors separately. We demonstrate this improvement with analytical arguments and supporting numerical simulations at low error rates. Of independent interest, we also demonstrate an exponential improvement in logical error rate for our decoder used to correct independent and identically distributed bit-flip errors affecting the color code compared with more conventional color-code decoding algorithms.},

	abstract = {Scalable generation of genuine multipartite entanglement with an increasing number of qubits is important for both fundamental interest and practical use in quantum-information technologies1,2. On the one hand, multipartite entanglement shows a strong contradiction between the prediction of quantum mechanics and local realization and can be used for the study of quantum-to-classical transition3,4. On the other hand, realizing large-scale entanglement is a benchmark for the quality and controllability of the quantum system and is essential for realizing universal quantum computing5–8. However, scalable generation of genuine multipartite entanglement on a state-of-the-art quantum device can be challenging, requiring accurate quantum gates and efficient verification protocols. Here we show a scalable approach for preparing and verifying intermediate-scale genuine entanglement on a 66-qubit superconducting quantum processor. We used high-fidelity parallel quantum gates and optimized the fidelitites of parallel single- and two-qubit gates to be 99.91\% and 99.05\%, respectively. With efficient randomized fidelity estimation9, we realized 51-qubit one-dimensional and 30-qubit two-dimensional cluster states and achieved fidelities of 0.637 ± 0.030 and 0.671 ± 0.006, respectively. On the basis of high-fidelity cluster states, we further show a proof-of-principle realization of measurement-based variational quantum eigensolver10 for perturbed planar codes.

	abstract = {Long-range entanglement—the backbone of topologically ordered states—cannot be created in finite time using local unitary circuits, or, equivalently, adiabatic state preparation. Recently, it has come to light that single-site measurements provide a loophole, allowing for finite-time state preparation in certain cases. Here we show how this observation imposes a complexity hierarchy on long-range entangled states based on the minimal number of measurement layers required to create the state, which we call “shots.” First, similar to Abelian stabilizer states, we construct single-shot protocols for creating any non-Abelian quantum double of a group with nilpotency class 2 (such as D4 or Q8). We show that after the measurement, the wave function always collapses into the desired non-Abelian topological order, conditional on recording the measurement outcome. Moreover, the clean quantum double ground state can be deterministically prepared via feedforward—gates that depend on the measurement outcomes. Second, we provide the first constructive proof that a finite number of shots can implement the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation (i.e., the gauging map) for any solvable symmetry group. As a special case, this gives an explicit protocol to prepare twisted quantum doubles for all solvable groups. Third, we argue that certain topological orders, such as nonsolvable quantum doubles or Fibonacci anyons, define nontrivial phases of matter under the equivalence class of finite-depth unitaries and measurement, which cannot be prepared by any finite number of shots. Moreover, we explore the consequences of allowing gates to have exponentially small tails, which enables, for example, the preparation of any Abelian anyon theory, including chiral ones. This hierarchy paints a new picture of the landscape of long-range entangled states, with practical implications for quantum simulators.},

Here, we show that this provides the ideal framework to understand and expand on the notion of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). In particular, applying a dual-unitary circuit to a many-body state followed by appropriate measurements effectively implements quantum computation in the spatial direction. We argue that this computation can be made deterministic by enforcing a Clifford condition, and is generically universal. Remarkably, all these requirements can already be satisfied by the dynamics of the paradigmatic kicked Ising chain at specific parameter choices. Specifically, after \$k\$ time-steps, equivalent to a depth-\$k\$ quantum circuit, we obtain a resource state for universal MBQC on \${\textbackslash}sim 3k/4\$ encoded logical qubits. This removes the usual requirement of going to two dimensions to achieve universality, thereby reducing the demands imposed on potential experimental platforms. Beyond the practical advantages, we also interpret this evolution as an infinite-order entangler for symmetry-protected topological chains, which gives a vast generalization of the celebrated cluster chain and shows that our protocol is robust to symmetry-respecting deformations.},

We diagnose spectral properties in the presence of measurements for the first time, along with standard, experimentally tractable probes of phase structure, finding no nontrivial effects due to measurements in the absence of feedback. We also establish that nonlinearity in the density matrix is neither sufficient nor necessary to see a transition, and instead identify utilization of the measurement outcomes (i.e., ``feedback'') as the crucial ingredient. After reviewing the definition of a phase of matter, we identify nontrivial orders in adaptive hybrid dynamics -- in which measurement outcomes determine future unitary gates -- finding a genuine measurement-induced absorbing-state phase transition in an adaptive quantum East model.

Here, we demonstrate that the so-called conformal quantum critical points (CQCP) can be obtained by performing general single-site measurements in an appropriate basis on the cluster states in \$d{\textbackslash}geq2\$. The equal-time correlators of the said states are described by correlation functions of certain \$d\$-dimensional classical models at finite temperatures and feature spatial conformal invariance. This establishes an exact correspondence between the measurement-prepared critical states and conformal field theories of a range of critical spin models, including familiar Ising models and gauge theories. Furthermore, by mapping the long-range entanglement structure of measured quantum states into the correlations of the corresponding thermal spin model, we rigorously establish the stability condition of the long-range entanglement in the measurement-prepared quantum states deviating from the ideal setting. Most importantly, we describe protocols to decode the resulting quantum phases and transitions without post-selection, thus transferring the exponential measurement complexity to a polynomial classical computation. Therefore, our findings suggest a novel mechanism in which a quantum critical wavefunction emerges, providing new practical ways to study quantum phases and conformal quantum critical points.},

In most encoding schemes, correcting or tracking errors throughout the computation is necessary to implement a universal gate set without adding significant delays in the processor. Here, we realize a classical control architecture for the fast extraction of errors based on multiple cycles of stabilizer measurements and subsequent correction. We demonstrate its application on a minimal bit-flip code with five transmon qubits, showing that real-time decoding and correction based on multiple stabilizers is superior in both speed and fidelity to repeated correction based on individual cycles. Furthermore, the encoded qubit can be rapidly measured, thus enabling conditional operations that rely on feed forward, such as logical gates. This co-processing of classical and quantum information will be crucial in running a logical circuit at its full speed to outpace error accumulation.},

Moreover, the known protocols for constructing reliable quantum computers from unreliable components can be complicated, often requiring many operations to produce a desired transformation.

            For certain restricted computational tasks, quantum mechanics provides a provable advantage over any possible classical implementation. Several of these results have been proven using the framework of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), where nonlocality and more generally contextuality have been identified as necessary resources for certain quantum computations. Here, we consider the computational power of MBQC in more detail by refining its resource requirements, both on the allowed operations and the number of accessible qubits. More precisely, we identify which Boolean functions can be computed in non-adaptive MBQC, with local operations contained within a finite level in the Clifford hierarchy. Moreover, for non-adaptive MBQC restricted to certain subtheories such as stabiliser MBQC, we compute the minimal number of qubits required to compute a given Boolean function. Our results point towards hierarchies of resources that more sharply characterise the power of MBQC beyond the binary of contextuality vs non-contextuality.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers have the potential to change the way we solve computational problems. Due to the noisy nature of qubits, the need arises to correct physical errors occurring during computation. The surface code is a promising candidate for such error correction that shows high threshold and which can store a logical quantum state on hardware with square-grid connectivity, a type of device that already exists. However, for logical quantum computation, the measurement of some irregular, non-local stabilisers is required, and it is not currently known how to do this without modifying the connectivity of the hardware. Here, we present a method to achieve this, closing this gap on the path to fault-tolerant quantum computation. We introduce a method of tangled syndrome extraction circuits, which enables measurement of observables between distant qubits. As an application of our tangling technique, we show how to measure the aforementioned irregular non-local stabilisers, without physically modifying the hardware itself. We present a concrete scheme that enables general lattice surgery with the planar code. Therefore, tangling enables fault-tolerant logical quantum computation using the surface code on square-grid connectivity architectures.},

	abstract = {Studies of quantum error correction (QEC) typically focus on stochastic Pauli errors because the existence of a threshold error rate below which stochastic Pauli errors can be corrected implies that there exists a threshold below which generic errors can be corrected. However, rigorous estimates of the threshold for generic errors are typically orders of magnitude worse than the threshold for stochastic Pauli errors. Specifically, coherent errors have a particularly harmful impact on the encoded space because they can map encoded states to superpositions of logical and error states. Further, coherent errors can add up and interfere over multiple rounds of error correction or between syndrome measurements, which may result in significantly worse errors than expected under a stochastic Pauli error model. In this paper, we present an algorithm which decoheres noise at the logical level, projecting the state of the system onto a logical state with a well-defined error. The algorithm does not significantly increase the depth of the logical circuit (and usually does not lead to any increase in depth), and applies generally to most fault-tolerant gadgets and error correction steps.},
