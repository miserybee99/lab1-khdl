  "abstract": "The spin phenomena observed at a clean metall-insulator interface are\ntypically reduced to Rashba-Edelstein effect, that leads to spin accumulation\nover a few monolayers. We demonstrate that the presence of interface disorder\nsignificantly expands the range of potential phenomena. Specifically, the skew\nscattering at the metal - insulator boundary gives rise to the \"kinetic\nRashba-Edelstein effect\", where spin accumulation occurs on a much larger\nlength scale comparable to mean free path. Moreover, at higher orders of\nspin-orbit interaction, skew scattering is accompanied with spin relaxation\nresulting in the interface spin-Hall effect - a conversion of electrical\ncurrent to spin current at the metal surface. Unlike the conventional spin-Hall\neffect, this phenomenon persists even within the Born approximation. These two\npredicted phenomena can dominate the spin density and spin current in devices\nof intermediate thickness.",
