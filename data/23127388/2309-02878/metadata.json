  "abstract": "Many-body correlations characterizing the Constrained Molecular Dynamics\n(CoMD)are analyzed in the case of finite and zero range effective microscopic\ninteractions. The study begins by analyzing the case of infinite nuclear matter\nat zero temperature. A comparison with the predictions in the mean-field(MF)\nlimit corresponding to different effective masses, highlights non-negligible\ndifferences regarding the produced Equation of State (EoS). A procedure is\nillustrated to determine the necessary corrections of the effective interaction\nparameters in the CoMD model so to reproduce the chosen EoS. The specific model\ncalculations, the general feature of the discussed correlations gives a wider\nmeaning to the resulting differences, which are in fact strongly related both\nto the Pauli principle constraint and to the localization effects related to\nwave-packets dynamics. Moving on to finite systems, preliminary results are\nshown in relation to the reaction mechanisms in the $^{64}Ni+^{48}Ca$ system\ndescribed by the CoMD model. Therefore, the topic covered illustrates the\neffects produced by the correlations of the CoMD dynamics on the EoS and on\nsome observables commonly studied in heavy ion collisions.",
