  "abstract": "We have carried out a systematic analysis of the gamma-ray bursts' (GRBs)\nlight curves detected in the SPI-ACS experiment onboard the INTEGRAL\nobservatory aimed to search extended emission. The emission occasionally\nrecorded after the prompt active phase of a GRB in the form of an emission that\nis longer than the active phase and less intense is called the extended one.\nOut of the 739 brightest GRBs recorded from 2002 to 2017, extended emission has\nbeen detected in $\\sim20\\%$ of the individual light curves; its maximum\nduration reaches $\\sim 10000$ s. Two different types of extended emission have\nbeen revealed. One of them is an additional component of the light curve and is\ndescribed by a power law (PL) with an index $\\alpha \\sim -1$ close to the PL\nindex of the afterglow in the optical and X-ray bands. The second type can be\ndescribed by a steeper PL decay of the light curve typical of the active burst\nphase. Extended emission has also been found in the combined light curve of\nlong GRBs in the individual curves of which no extended emission has been\ndetected. The PL index of the extended emission in the combined light curve is\n$\\alpha \\sim -2.4$. It is most likely associated with the superposition of\nlight curves at the active phase; its total duration is $\\sim 800$ s.",
