  "abstract": "Overlay management is the cornerstone of building robust and dependable\nPeer-to-Peer systems. A key component for building such overlays is the\npeer-sampling service, a mechanism that continuously supplies each node with a\nset of up-to-date peers randomly selected across all alive nodes. Arguably, the\nmost pernicious malicious action against such mechanisms is the provision of\narbitrarily created links that point at malicious nodes. This paper proposes\nSecureCyclon, a peer-sampling protocol that deterministically eliminates the\nability of malicious nodes to overrepresent themselves in Peer-to-Peer\noverlays. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first protocol to offer\nthis property, as previous works were able to only bound the proportion of\nexcessive links to malicious nodes, without completely eliminating them.\nSecureCyclon redefines the concept of node descriptors from just being\ncontainers of information that enable communication with specific nodes, to\nbeing communication certificates that traverse the network and enable nodes to\nprovably discover malicious nodes. We evaluate our solution with the conduction\nof extended simulations, and we demonstrate that it provides resilience even at\nthe extreme condition of 40% malicious node participation.",
