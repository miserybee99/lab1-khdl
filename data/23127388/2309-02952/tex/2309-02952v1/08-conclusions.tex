\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We presented \prot, a protocol that extends the legacy Cyclon peer-sampling protocol to shield it against arbitrary protocol violations.
\prot\ leverages the continuous exchange of node descriptors that is inherent in Cyclon, in order to disseminate evidence of malicious actions.
Such evidence can be utilized by correct nodes to construct indisputable proof of illicit actions, and to inadvertently expose the identity of the respective offenders, allowing legitimate nodes to blacklist them, protecting the network from their malicious actions.

Our evaluation demonstrates that \prot\ does not only prevent attacks with a reasonable malicious node participation, but also copes well with massive-scale attacks, as it gradually exposes and eliminates malicious nodes, blocking them from the legitimate part of the network.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first gossip-based peer-sampling protocol that not only confronts the problem of arbitrary protocol violations, but also exposes perpetrators with provable evidence of their malicious actions.
