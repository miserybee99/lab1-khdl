  "abstract": "Situated Visualization is an emerging field that unites several areas -\nvisualization, augmented reality, human-computer interaction, and\ninternet-of-things, to support human data activities within the ubiquitous\nworld. Likewise, dashboards are broadly used to simplify complex data through\nmultiple views. However, dashboards are only adapted for desktop settings, and\nrequires visual strategies to support situatedness. We propose the concept of\nAR-based situated dashboards and present design considerations and challenges\ndeveloped over interviews with experts. These challenges aim to propose\ndirections and opportunities for facilitating the effective designing and\nauthoring of situated dashboards.",
