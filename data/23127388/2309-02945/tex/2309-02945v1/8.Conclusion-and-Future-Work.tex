\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this position paper, we proposed and investigated the concept of situated dashboards. We identified key design considerations and challenges through interviews with six researchers in (situated) visualization and/or AR. It is apparent that there is no singular agreed upon definition of situated dashboards, let alone their design, behavior, and interactivity. Thus, future work on situated dashboards and analytics as a whole may need to support a wide range of different designs and contexts, in order to support the needs of a wide range of end-users. The challenges we identified thus serve as future research directions in service of this broader goal.
