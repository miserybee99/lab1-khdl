  "abstract": "Verona is a concurrent object-oriented programming language that organises\nall the objects in a program into a forest of isolated regions. Memory is\nmanaged locally for each region, so programmers can control a program's memory\nuse by adjusting objects' partition into regions, and by setting each region's\nmemory management strategy. A thread can only mutate (allocate, deallocate)\nobjects within one active region -- its \"window of mutability\". Memory\nmanagement costs are localised to the active region, ensuring overheads can be\npredicted and controlled. Moving the mutability window between regions is\nexplicit, so code can be executed wherever it is required, yet programs remain\nin control of memory use. An ownership type system based on reference\ncapabilities enforces region isolation, controlling aliasing within and between\nregions, yet supporting objects moving between regions and threads. Data\naccesses never need expensive atomic operations, and are always thread-safe.",
