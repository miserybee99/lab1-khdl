For efficient data transfer, data should be passed by reference whenever possible, but this introduces aliasing and undermines the validity of the active objects. This paper proposes a minimal variant of ownership types that preserves the required race freedom invariant yet enables data transfer by reference between active objects (that is, without copying) in many cases, and a cheap clone operation where copying is necessary. Our approach is general and should be adaptable to several existing active object systems.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel runtime ownership model that supports the first memory isolation model of actors with these three properties—it is safe, developer-friendly, and efficient.},

	abstract = {Concurrent object-oriented programming languages coordinate conflicting memory accesses through locking, which relies on programmer discipline and suffers from a lack of modularity and compile-time support. Programmers typically work with large libraries of code whose locking behaviours are not formally and precisely specified; thus understanding and writing concurrent programs is notoriously difficult and error-prone. This paper proposes structural lock correlation, a new model for establishing structural connections between locks and the memory locations they protect, in an ownership-based type and effect system. Structural lock correlation enables modular specification of locking. It offers a compiler-checkable lock abstraction with an enforceable contract at interface boundaries, leading to improved safety, understandability and composability of concurrent program components.},

The two useful tricolour invariants are derived from more elementary considerations of graph traversal. Barrier techniques for maintaining these invariants are classified according to the action taken at the barrier (such as scanning an object or changing its colour), and it is shown that the algorithms described in the literature cover all the possibilities except one. Unfortunately, the new technique is impractical. Ways of combining barrier techniques are also discussed.},

	abstract = {A real-time list processing system is one in which the time required by the elementary list operations (e.g. CONS, CAR, CDR, RPLACA, RPLACD, EQ, and ATOM in LISP) is bounded by a (small) constant. Classical implementations of list processing systems lack this property because allocating a list cell from the heap may cause a garbage collection, which process requires time proportional to the heap size to finish. A real-time list processing system is presented which continuously reclaims garbage, including directed cycles, while linearizing and compacting the accessible cells into contiguous locations to avoid fragmenting the free storage pool. The program is small and requires no time-sharing interrupts, making it suitable for microcode. Finally, the system requires the same average time, and not more than twice the space, of a classical implementation, and those space requirements can be reduced to approximately classical proportions by compact list representation. Arrays of different sizes, a program stack, and hash linking are simple extensions to our system, and reference counting is found to be inferior for many applications.},

T he early chapters present the basic tenets of Bayesian thinking by use of familiar one and two-parameter inferential problems. Bayesian computational methods such as Laplace's method, rejection sampling, and the SIR algorithm are illustrated in the context of a random effects model. The construction and implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is introduced. These simulation-based algorithms are implemented for a variety of Bayesian applications such as normal and binary response regression, hierarchical modeling, order-restricted inference, and robust modeling. Algorithms written in R are used to develop Bayesian tests and assess Bayesian models by use of the posterior predictive distribution. The use of R to interface with WinBUGS, a popular MCMC computing language, is described with several illustrative examples. The second edition contains several new topics such as the use of mixtures of conjugate priors and the use of Zellner's g priors to choose between models in linear regression. There are more illustrations of the construction of informative prior distributions, such as the use of conditional means priors and multivariate normal priors in binary regressions. The new edition contains changes in the R code illustrations according to the latest edition of the LearnBayes package.},

Although necessary to construct linked data structures and networks of interacting objects, aliasing is problematic in that an aggregate object's state can change via an alias to one of its components, without the aggregate being aware of any aliasing.Ownership types form a static type system that indicates object ownership. This provides a flexible mechanism to limit the visibility of object references and restrict access paths to objects, thus controlling a system's dynamic topology. The type system is shown to be sound, and the specific aliasing properties that a system's object graph satisfies are formulated and proven invariant for well-typed programs.},

We extend ownership types with computational effects to support reasoning about object-oriented programs. The ensuing system provides both access control and effects reporting. Based on this type system, we codify two formal systems for reasoning about aliasing and the disjointness of computational effects. The first can be used to prove that evaluation of two expressions will never lead to aliases, while the latter can be used to show the non-interference of two expressions.},

The idea is that an externally unique reference is the only reference into an aggregate from outside the aggregate. Internal references which do not escape the boundary of the aggregate are innocuous and therefore permitted. Based on ownership types, our proposal not only overcomes an abstraction problem from which existing uniqueness proposals suffer, it also enables many examples which are inherently not unique, such as a unique reference to a set of links in a doubly-linked list, without losing the benefits of uniqueness.",

Chapters include clustering, supervised classification, and working with missing values. A variety of plots and interaction methods are used in each analysis, often starting with brushing linked low-dimensional views and working up to manual manipulation of tours of several variables. The role of graphical methods is shown at each step of the analysis, not only in the early exploratory phase, but in the later stages, too, when comparing and evaluating models. All examples are based on freely available software: GGobi for interactive graphics and R for static graphics, modeling, and programming. The printed book is augmented by a wealth of material on the web, encouraging readers follow the examples themselves. The web site has all the data and code necessary to reproduce the analyses in the book, along with movies demonstrating the examples.},

	abstract = {Time Series Analysis With Applications in R, Second Edition, presents an accessible approach to understanding time series models and their applications. Although the emphasis is on time domain ARIMA models and their analysis, the new edition devotes two chapters to the frequency domain and three to time series regression models, models for heteroscedasticty, and threshold models. All of the ideas and methods are illustrated with both real and simulated data sets. A unique feature of this edition is its integration with the R computing environment. The tables and graphical displays are accompanied by the R commands used to produce them. An extensive R package, TSA, which contains many new or revised R functions and all of the data used in the book, accompanies the written text. Script files of R commands for each chapter are available for download. There is also an extensive appendix in the book that leads the reader through the use of R commands and the new R package to carry out the analyses.},

	abstract = {Since the early 2000s, in order to keep up with the performance predictions of Moore's law, hardware vendors have had to turn to multi-core computers. Today, parallel hardware is everywhere, from massive server halls to the phones in our pockets. However, this parallelism does not come for free. Programs must explicitly be written to allow for concurrent execution, which adds complexity that is not present in sequential programs. In particular, if two concurrent processes share the same memory, care must be taken so that they do not overwrite each other's data. This issue of data-races is exacerbated in object-oriented languages, where shared memory in the form of aliasing is ubiquitous. Unfortunately, most mainstream programming languages were designed with sequential programming in mind, and therefore provide little or no support for handling this complexity. Even though programming abstractions like locks can be used to synchronise accesses to shared memory, the burden of using these abstractions correctly and efficiently is left to the programmer. The contribution of this thesis is programming language technology for controlling concurrency in the presence of shared memory. It is based on the concept of reference capabilities, which facilitate safe concurrent programming by restricting how memory may be accessed and shared. Reference capabilities can be used to enforce correct synchronisation when accessing shared memory, as well as to prevent unsafe sharing when using more fine-grained concurrency control, such as lock-free programming. This thesis presents the design of a capability-based type system with low annotation overhead, that can statically guarantee the absence of data-races without giving up object-oriented features like aliasing, subtyping and code reuse. The type system is formally proven safe, and has been implemented for the highly concurrent object-oriented programming language Encore.},

abstract = {This paper presents a static race detection analysis for multithreaded Java programs. Our analysis is based on a formal type system that is capable of capturing many common synchronization patterns. These patterns include classes with internal synchronization, classes thatrequire client-side synchronization, and thread-local classes. Experience checking over 40,000 lines of Java code with the type system demonstrates that it is an effective approach for eliminating races conditions. On large examples, fewer than 20 additional type annotations per 1000 lines of code were required by the type checker, and we found a number of races in the standard Java libraries and other test programs.},

	isbn = {978-0-387-75838-1},
	abstract = {This book is very different from any other publication in the field and it is unique because of its focus on the practical implementation of the simulation and estimation methods presented. The book should be useful to practitioners and students with minimal mathematical background, but because of the many R programs, probably also to many mathematically well educated practitioners. Many of the methods presented in the book have, so far, not been used much in practice because the lack of an implementation in a unified framework. This book fills the gap. With the R code included in this book, a lot of useful methods become easy to use for practitioners and students. An R package called `sde' provides functionswith easy interfaces ready to be used on empirical data from real life applications. Although it contains a wide range of results, the book has an introductory character and necessarily does not cover the whole spectrum of simulation and inference for general stochastic differential equations. The book is organized in four chapters. The first one introduces the subject and presents several classes of processes used in many fields of mathematics, computational biology, finance and the social sciences. The second chapter is devoted to simulation schemes and covers new methods not available in other milestones publication known so far. The third one is focused on parametric estimation techniques. In particular, it includes exact likelihood inference, approximated and pseudo-likelihood methods, estimating functions, generalized method of moments and other techniques. The last chapter contains miscellaneous topics like nonparametric estimation, model identification and change point estimation. The reader non-expert in R language, will find a concise introduction to this environment focused on the subject of the book which should allow for instant use of the proposed material. To each R functions presented in the book a documentation page is available at the end of the book.},

	title = {Applied {Econometrics} with {R}},
	isbn = {978-0-387-77316-2},
	abstract = {This is the first book on applied econometrics using the R system for statistical computing and graphics. It presents hands-on examples for a wide range of econometric models, from classical linear regression models for cross-section, time series or panel data and the common non-linear models of microeconometrics such as logit, probit and tobit models, to recent semiparametric extensions. In addition, it provides a chapter on programming, including simulations, optimization, and an introduction to R tools enabling reproducible econometric research. An R package accompanying this book, AER, is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AER. It contains some 100 data sets taken from a wide variety of sources, the full source code for all examples used in the text plus further worked examples, e.g., from popular textbooks. The data sets are suitable for illustrating, among other things, the fitting of wage equations, growth regressions, hedonic regressions, dynamic regressions and time series models as well as models of labor force participation or the demand for health care. The goal of this book is to provide a guide to R for users with a background in economics or the social sciences. Readers are assumed to have a background in basic statistics and econometrics at the undergraduate level. A large number of examples should make the book of interest to graduate students, researchers and practitioners alike.},

	abstract = {Abstract–Lock-free objects offer significant performance and reliability advantages over conventional lock-based objects. However, the lack of an efficient portable lock-free method for the reclamation of the memory occupied by dynamic nodes removed from such objects is a major obstacle to their wide use in practice. This paper presents hazard pointers, a memory management methodology that allows memory reclamation for arbitrary reuse. It is very efficient, as demonstrated by our experimental results. It is suitable for user-level applications–as well as system programs–without dependence on special kernel or scheduler support. It is wait-free. It requires only single-word reads and writes for memory access in its core operations. It allows reclaimed memory to be returned to the operating system. In addition, it offers a lock-free solution for the ABA problem using only practical single-word instructions. Our experimental results on a multiprocessor system show that the new methodology offers equal and, more often, significantly better performance than other memory management methods, in addition to its qualitative advantages regarding memory reclamation and independence of special hardware support. We also show that lock-free implementations of important object types, using hazard pointers, offer comparable performance to that of efficient lock-based implementations under no contention and no multiprogramming, and outperform them by significant margins under moderate multiprogramming and/or contention, in addition to guaranteeing continuous progress and availability, even in the presence of thread failures and arbitrary delays.},

	title = {Language {Constructs} for {Safe} {Parallel} {Programming} on {Multi}-{Cores}},
	abstract = {The last decade has seen the transition from single-core processors to multi-cores and many-cores. This move has by and large shifted the responsibility from chip manufacturers to programmers to keep up with ever-increasing expectations on performance. In the single-core era, improvements in hardware capacity could immediately be leveraged by an application: faster machine - faster program. In the age of the multi-cores, this is no longer the case. Programs must be written in specific ways to utilize available parallel hardware resources. Programming language support for concurrent and parallel programming is poor in most popular object-oriented programming languages. Shared memory, threads and locks is the most common concurrency model provided. Threads and locks are hard to understand, error-prone and inflexible; they break encapsulation - the very foundation of the object-oriented approach. This makes it hard to break large complex problems into smaller pieces which can be solved independently and composed to make a whole. Ubiquitous parallelism and object-orientation, seemingly, do not match. Actors, or active objects, have been proposed as a concurrency model better fit for object-oriented programming than threads and locks. Asynchronous message passing between actors each with a logical thread of control preserves encapsulation as objects themselves decide when messages are executed. Unfortunately most implementations of active objects do not prevent sharing of mutable objects across actors. Sharing, whether on purpose or by accident, exposes objects to multiple threads of control, destroying object encapsulation. In this thesis we show techniques for compiler-enforced isolation of active objects, while allowing sharing and zero-copy communication of mutable data in the cases where it is safe to do so. We also show how the same techniques that enforce isolation can be utilized internal to an active object to allow data race-free parallel message processing and data race-free structured parallel computations. This overcomes the coarse-grained nature of active object parallelism without compromising safety.},

This book not only introduces the reader to this topic but enables him to conduct the various unit root tests and co-integration methods on his own by utilizing the free statistical programming environment R. The book encompasses seasonal unit roots, fractional integration, coping with structural breaks, and multivariate time series models. The book is enriched by numerous programming examples to artificial and real data so that it is ideally suited as an accompanying text book to computer lab classes. The second edition adds a discussion of vector auto-regressive, structural vector auto-regressive, and structural vector error-correction models. To analyze the interactions between the investigated variables, further impulse response function and forecast error variance decompositions are introduced as well as forecasting. The author explains how these model types relate to each other. Bernhard Pfaff studied economics at the universities of Göttingen, Germany; Davis, California; and Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany. He obtained a diploma and a doctorate degree at the economics department of the latter entity where he was employed as a research and teaching assistant. He has worked for many years as economist and quantitative analyst in research departments of financial institutions and he is the author and maintainer of the contributed R packages “urca” and “vars.”},

	title = {The {Foundations} of {Statistics}: {A} {Simulation}-based {Approach}},
	isbn = {978-3-642-16312-8},
	abstract = {Statistics and hypothesis testing are routinely used in areas (such as linguistics) that are traditionally not mathematically intensive. In such fields, when faced with experimental data, many students and researchers tend to rely on commercial packages to carry out statistical data analysis, often without understanding the logic of the statistical tests they rely on. As a consequence, results are often misinterpreted, and users have difficulty in flexibly applying techniques relevant to their own research they use whatever they happen to have learned. A simple solution is to teach the fundamental ideas of statistical hypothesis testing without using too much mathematics. This book provides a non-mathematical, simulation-based introduction to basic statistical concepts and encourages readers to try out the simulations themselves using the source code and data provided (the freely available programming language R is used throughout). Since the code presented in the text almost always requires the use of previously introduced programming constructs, diligent students also acquire basic programming abilities in R. The book is intended for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in any discipline, although the focus is on linguistics, psychology, and cognitive science. It is designed for self-instruction, but it can also be used as a textbook for a first course on statistics. Earlier versions of the book have been used in undergraduate and graduate courses in Europe and the US.},

While firmly focused on the practical aspects of GAMs, discussions include fairly full explanations of the theory underlying the methods. The treatment is rich with practical examples, and it includes an entire chapter on the analysis of real data sets using R and the author's add-on package mgcv.

	abstract = {Communicating Event-Loop Languages similar to E and AmbientTalk are recently gaining more traction as a subset of actor languages. With the rise of JavaScript, E’s notion of vats and non-blocking communication based on promises entered the mainstream. For implementations, the combination of dynamic typing, asynchronous message sending, and promise resolution pose new optimization challenges. This paper discusses these challenges and presents initial experiments for a Newspeak implementation based on the Truffle framework. Our implementation is on average 1.65x slower than Java on a set of 14 benchmarks. Initial optimizations improve the performance of asynchronous messages and reduce the cost of encapsulation on microbenchmarks by about 2x. Parallel actor benchmarks further show that the system scales based on the workload characteristics. Thus, we conclude that Truffle is a promising platform also for communicating event-loop languages.},

Finally, we briefly speculate on what may come after object-oriented programming and conclude that it is a robust component-based modeling paradigm that is both effective and fundamental.

abstract = {We introduce Isolde, an automatic garbage collection scheme designed specifically for managing memory in lock-free data structures, such as stacks, lists, maps and queues. Isolde exists as a plug-in memory manager, designed to sit on-top of another memory manager, and use it's allocator and reclaimer (if exists). Isolde treats a lock-free data structure as a logical heap, isolated from the rest of the program. This allows garbage collection outside of Isolde to take place without affecting the lock-free data structure. Isolde further manages objects allocated on a Isolde heap in a fully concurrent manner, allowing garbage collection to incrementally remove garbage without stopping other threads doing work.},

We prove that well-typed programs do not go wrong and are data-race free. Our definitions and proofs are machine-checked.},

abstract="Aliasing is endemic in object oriented programming. Because an object can be modified via any alias, object oriented programs are hard to understand, maintain, and analyse. Flexible alias protection is a conceptual model of inter-object relationships which limits the visibility of changes via aliases, allowing objects to be aliased but mitigating the undesirable effects of aliasing. Flexible alias protection can be checked statically using programmer supplied aliasing modes and imposes no runtime overhead. Using flexible alias protection, programs can incorporate mutable objects, immutable values, and updatable collections of shared objects, in a natural object oriented programming style, while avoiding the problems caused by aliasing.",

	abstract = {We present a technique for efficient stateless model checking of programs that execute under the relaxed memory models TSO and PSO. The basis for our technique is a novel representation of executions under TSO and PSO, called chronological traces. Chronological traces induce a partial order relation on relaxed memory executions, capturing dependencies that are needed to represent the interaction via shared variables. They are optimal in the sense that they only distinguish computations that are inequivalent under the widely-used representation by Shasha and Snir. This allows an optimal dynamic partial order reduction algorithm to explore a minimal number of executions while still guaranteeing full coverage. We apply our techniques to check, under the TSO and PSO memory models, LLVM assembly produced for C/pthreads programs. Our experiments show that our technique reduces the verification effort for relaxed memory models to be almost that for the standard model of sequential consistency.

The specific constraint expressed is that the abstract state of the object to which an immutable reference refers cannot be modified using that reference. The abstract state is (part of) the transitively reachable state: that is, the state of the object and all state reachable from it by following references. The type system permits explicitly excluding fields from the abstract state of an object. For a statically type-safe language, the type system guarantees reference immutability. If the language is extended with immutability downcasts, then run-time checks enforce the reference immutability constraints.This research builds upon previous research in language support for reference immutability. Improvements that are new in this paper include distinguishing the notions of assignability and mutability; integration with Java 5's generic types and with multi-dimensional arrays; a mutability polymorphism approach to avoiding code duplication; type-safe support for reflection and serialization; and formal type rules and type soundness proof for a core calculus.

abstract = {Efficient ordered in-memory key-value (KV-)maps are paramount for the scalability of modern data platforms. In managed languages like Java, KV-maps face unique challenges due to the high overhead of garbage collection (GC).We present Oak, a scalable concurrent KV-map for environments with managed memory. Oak offloads data from the managed heap, thereby reducing GC overheads and improving memory utilization. An important consideration in this context is the programming model since a standard object-based API entails moving data between the on- and off-heap spaces. In order to avoid the cost associated with such movement, we introduce a novel zero-copy (ZC) API. It provides atomic get, put, remove, and various conditional put operations such as compute (in-situ update).We have released an open-source Java version of Oak. We further present a prototype Oak-based implementation of the internal multidimensional index in Apache Druid. Our experiments show that Oak is often 2x faster than Java's state-of-the-art concurrent skiplist.},

Recent work on real-time garbage collectors has shown that it is possible to provide guarantees on worst-case pause times and minimum mutator utilization time. This paper presents a new hierarchical real-time garbage collection algorithm for mixed-priority and mixed-criticality environments. With hierarchical garbage collection, real-time programmers can partition the heap into a number of heaplets and for each partition choose to run a separate collector with a schedule that matches the allocation behavior and footprint of the real-time task using it. This approach lowers worst-case response times of real-time applications by 26%, while almost doubling mutator utilization -- all with only minimal changes to the application code.},

Assuming most objects are created and used by a single thread, it is desirable to free the memory manager from redundant synchronization for thread-local objects. Therefore, in our scheme each thread receives a partition of the heap in which it allocates its objects and in which it does local garbage collection without synchronization with other threads. We dynamically monitor to determine which objects are local and which are global. Furthermore, we suggest using profiling to identify allocation sites that almost exclusively allocate global objects, and allocate objects at these sites directly in a global area.We have implemented the thread-local heap memory manager and a preliminary mechanism for direct global allocation on an IBM prototype of JDK 1.3.0 for Windows. Our measurements of thread-local heaps with direct global allocation on a 4-way multiprocessor IBM Netfinity server show that the overall garbage collection times have been substantially reduced, and that most long pauses have been eliminated.},

abstract = {To achieve short pauses, state-of-the-art concurrent copying collectors such as C4, Shenandoah, and ZGC use substantially more CPU cycles and memory than simpler collectors. They suffer from design limitations: i) concurrent copying with inherently expensive read and write barriers, ii) scalability limitations due to tracing, and iii) immediacy limitations for mature objects that impose memory overheads. This paper takes a different approach to optimizing responsiveness and throughput. It uses the insight that regular, brief stop-the-world collections deliver sufficient responsiveness at greater efficiency than concurrent evacuation. It introduces LXR, where stop-the-world collections use reference counting (RC) and judicious copying. RC delivers scalability and immediacy, promptly reclaiming young and mature objects. RC, in a hierarchical Immix heap structure, reclaims most memory without any copying. Occasional concurrent tracing identifies cyclic garbage. LXR introduces: i) RC remembered sets for judicious copying of mature objects; ii) a novel low-overhead write barrier that combines coalescing reference counting, concurrent tracing, and remembered set maintenance; iii) object reclamation while performing a concurrent trace; iv) lazy processing of decrements; and v) novel survival rate triggers that modulate pause durations. LXR combines excellent responsiveness and throughput, improving over production collectors. On the widely-used Lucene search engine in a tight heap, LXR delivers 7.8\texttimes{} better throughput and 10\texttimes{} better 99.99% tail latency than Shenandoah. On 17 diverse modern workloads in a moderate heap, LXR outperforms OpenJDK’s default G1 on throughput by 4% and Shenandoah by 43%.},

abstract = {The Real Time Specification for Java (RTSJ) allows a program to create real-time threads with hard real-time constraints. Real-time threads use region-based memory management to avoid unbounded pauses caused by interference from the garbage collector. The RTSJ uses runtime checks to ensure that deleting a region does not create dangling references and that real-time threads do not access references to objects allocated in the garbage-collected heap. This paper presents a static type system that guarantees that these runtime checks will never fail for well-typed programs. Our type system therefore 1) provides an important safety guarantee for real-time programs and 2) makes it possible to eliminate the runtime checks and their associated overhead.Our system also makes several contributions over previous work on region types. For object-oriented programs, it combines the benefits of region types and ownership types in a unified type system framework. For multithreaded programs, it allows long-lived threads to share objects without using the heap and without memory leaks. For real-time programs, it ensures that real-time threads do not interfere with the garbage collector. Our experience indicates that our type system is sufficiently expressive and requires little programming overhead, and that eliminating the RTSJ runtime checks using a static type system can significantly decrease the execution time of real-time programs.},

Using type annotations that make the structure of a program's regions more explicit, we reduce the overhead of reference counting from a maximum of 27% to a maximum of 11% on a suite of realistic benchmarks. We generalise these annotations in a region type system whose main novelty is the use of existentially quantified abstract regions to represent pointers to objects whose region is partially or totally unknown.

abstract = {It is well known that modern functional programming languages are naturally amenable to parallel programming. Achieving efficient parallelism using functional languages, however, remains difficult. Perhaps the most important reason for this is their lack of support for efficient in-place updates, i.e., mutation, which is important for the implementation of both parallel algorithms and the run-time system services (e.g., schedulers and synchronization primitives) used to execute them.In this paper, we propose techniques for efficient mutation in parallel functional languages. To this end, we couple the memory manager with the thread scheduler to make reading and updating data allocated by nested threads efficient. We describe the key algorithms behind our technique, implement them in the MLton Standard ML compiler, and present an empirical evaluation. Our experiments show that the approach performs well, significantly improving efficiency over existing functional language implementations.},

To enforce data-race freedom, these languages either deep copy objects during actor (thread) communication or proxy back to their owning thread. We present Dala, a simple programming model that ensures data-race freedom while supporting efficient inter-thread communication. Dala is a dynamic, concurrent, capability-based language that relies on three core capabilities: immutable values can be shared freely; isolated mutable objects can be transferred between threads but not aliased; local objects can be aliased within their owning thread but not dereferenced by other threads. Objects with capabilities can co-exist with unsafe objects, that are unchecked and may suffer data races, without compromising the safety of safe objects. We present a formal model of Dala, prove data race-freedom and state and prove a dynamic gradual guarantee. These theorems guarantee data race-freedom when using safe capabilities and show that the addition of capabilities is semantics preserving modulo permission and cast errors.},

abstract = {Parallelism is often required for performance. In these situations an excess of non-determinism is harmful as it means the program can have several different behaviours or even different results. Even in domains such as high-performance computing where parallelism is crucial for performance, the computed value should be deterministic. Unfortunately, non-determinism in programs also allows dynamic scheduling of tasks, reacting to the first task that succeeds, cancelling tasks that cannot lead to a result, and so on. Non-determinism is thus both a desired asset or an undesired property depending on the situation. In practice, it is often necessary to limit non-determinism and to identify precisely the sources of non-determinism to control what parts of a program are deterministic or not.This survey takes the perspective of programming languages, and studies how programming models can ensure the determinism of parallel programs. This survey studies not only deterministic languages but also programming models that prevent one particularly demanding source of non-determinism: data races.Our objective is to compare existing solutions to the following questions: How programming languages can help programmers write programs that run in a parallel manner without visible non-determinism? What programming paradigms ensure this kind of properties? We study these questions and discuss the merits and limitations of different approaches.},

Effect systems enable tracking such information in types, but at the cost of complicating signatures of common functions. Capabilities coupled with escape analysis offer safety and natural signatures, but are often overly coarse grained and restrictive. We present System C, which builds on and generalizes ideas from type-based escape analysis and demonstrates that capabilities and effects can be reconciled harmoniously. By assuming that all functions are second class, we can admit natural signatures for many common programs. By introducing a notion of boxed values, we can lift the restrictions of second-class values at the cost of needing to track degree-of-impurity information in types. The system we present is expressive enough to support effect handlers in full capacity. We practically evaluate System C in an implementation and prove its soundness.},

abstract = {Rust is a general-purpose programming language that is both type-and memory-safe. Rust does not use a garbage collector, but rather achieves these properties through a sophisticated, but complex, type system. Doing so makes Rust very efficient, but makes Rust relatively hard to learn and use. We designed Bronze, an optional, library-based garbage collector for Rust. To see whether Bronze could make Rust more usable, we conducted a randomized controlled trial with volunteers from a 633--person class, collecting data from 428 students in total. We found that for a task that required managing complex aliasing, Bronze users were more likely to complete the task in the time available, and those who did so required only about a third as much time (4 hours vs. 12 hours). We found no significant difference in total time, even though Bronze users re-did the task without Bronze afterward. Surveys indicated that ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes were primary causes of the challenges that users faced when using Rust.},

abstract = {Type systems are useful not just for the safety guarantees they provide, but also for helping compilers generate more efficient code by simplifying important program analyses. In Rust, the type system imposes a strict discipline on pointer aliasing, and it is an express goal of the Rust compiler developers to make use of that alias information for the purpose of program optimizations that reorder memory accesses. The problem is that Rust also supports unsafe code, and programmers can write unsafe code that bypasses the usual compiler checks to violate the aliasing discipline. To strike a balance between optimizations and unsafe code, the language needs to provide a set of rules such that unsafe code authors can be sure, if they are following these rules, that the compiler will preserve the semantics of their code despite all the optimizations it is doing. In this work, we propose Stacked Borrows, an operational semantics for memory accesses in Rust. Stacked Borrows defines an aliasing discipline and declares programs violating it to have undefined behavior, meaning the compiler does not have to consider such programs when performing optimizations. We give formal proofs (mechanized in Coq) showing that this rules out enough programs to enable optimizations that reorder memory accesses around unknown code and function calls, based solely on intraprocedural reasoning. We also implemented this operational model in an interpreter for Rust and ran large parts of the Rust standard library test suite in the interpreter to validate that the model permits enough real-world unsafe Rust code.},

abstract = {Java is a safe language. Its runtime environment provides strong safety guarantees that any Java application can rely on. Or so we think. We show that the runtime actually does not provide these guarantees---for a large fraction of today's Java code. Unbeknownst to many application developers, the Java runtime includes a "backdoor" that allows expert library and framework developers to circumvent Java's safety guarantees. This backdoor is there by design, and is well known to experts, as it enables them to write high-performance "systems-level" code in Java. For much the same reasons that safe languages are preferred over unsafe languages, these powerful---but unsafe---capabilities in Java should be restricted. They should be made safe by changing the language, the runtime system, or the libraries. At the very least, their use should be restricted. This paper is a step in that direction. We analyzed 74 GB of compiled Java code, spread over 86,479 Java archives, to determine how Java's unsafe capabilities are used in real-world libraries and applications. We found that 25% of Java bytecode archives depend on unsafe third-party Java code, and thus Java's safety guarantees cannot be trusted. We identify 14 different usage patterns of Java's unsafe capabilities, and we provide supporting evidence for why real-world code needs these capabilities. Our long-term goal is to provide a foundation for the design of new language features to regain safety in Java.},
