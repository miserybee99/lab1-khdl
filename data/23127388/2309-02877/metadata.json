  "abstract": "The Nystr\\\"om method offers an effective way to obtain low-rank approximation\nof SPD matrices, and has been recently extended and analyzed to nonsymmetric\nmatrices (leading to the generalized Nystr\\\"om method). It is a randomized,\nsingle-pass, streamable, cost-effective, and accurate alternative to the\nrandomized SVD, and it facilitates the computation of several matrix low-rank\nfactorizations.\n  In this paper, we take these advancements a step further by introducing a\nhigher-order variant of Nystr\\\"om's methodology tailored to approximating\nlow-rank tensors in the Tucker format: the multilinear Nystr\\\"om technique. We\nshow that, by introducing appropriate small modifications in the formulation of\nthe higher-order method, strong stability properties can be obtained. This\nalgorithm retains the key attributes of the generalized Nystr\\\"om method,\npositioning it as a viable substitute for the randomized higher-order SVD\nalgorithm.",
