  "abstract": "Reconstructing both objects and hands in 3D from a single RGB image is\ncomplex. Existing methods rely on manually defined hand-object constraints in\nEuclidean space, leading to suboptimal feature learning. Compared with\nEuclidean space, hyperbolic space better preserves the geometric properties of\nmeshes thanks to its exponentially-growing space distance, which amplifies the\ndifferences between the features based on similarity. In this work, we propose\nthe first precise hand-object reconstruction method in hyperbolic space, namely\nDynamic Hyperbolic Attention Network (DHANet), which leverages intrinsic\nproperties of hyperbolic space to learn representative features. Our method\nthat projects mesh and image features into a unified hyperbolic space includes\ntwo modules, ie. dynamic hyperbolic graph convolution and image-attention\nhyperbolic graph convolution. With these two modules, our method learns mesh\nfeatures with rich geometry-image multi-modal information and models better\nhand-object interaction. Our method provides a promising alternative for fine\nhand-object reconstruction in hyperbolic space. Extensive experiments on three\npublic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms most state-of-the-art\nmethods.",
