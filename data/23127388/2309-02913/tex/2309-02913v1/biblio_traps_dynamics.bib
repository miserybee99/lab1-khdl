 title = "The Optimal and the Greedy: Drone Association and Positioning Schemes for Internet of {UAV}s",
abstract = "This work considers the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAV}s) over a pre-defined area to serve a number of ground users. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the network, the {UAV}s may cause severe interference to the transmissions of each other. Hence, a judicious design of the user-{UAV} association and {UAV} locations is desired. A potential game is defined where the players are the {UAV}s. The potential function is the total sum-rate of the users. The agents{\textquoteright} utility in the potential game is their marginal contribution to the global welfare or their socalled wonderful life utility. A game-theoretic learning algorithm, binary log-linear learning (BLLL), is then applied to the problem. Given the potential game structure, a consequence of our utility design, the stochastically stable states using BLLL are guaranteed to be the potential maximizers. Hence, we optimally solve the joint user-{UAV} association and 3D-location problem. Next, we exploit the submodular features of the sum rate function for a given configuration of {UAV}s to design an efficient greedy algorithm. Despite the simplicity of the greedy algorithm, it comes with a performance guarantee of 1-1/e of the optimal solution. To further reduce the number of iterations, we propose another heuristic greedy algorithm that provides very good results. Our simulations show that, in practice, the proposed greedy approaches achieve significant performance in a few iterations.",

  title={Trajectory Optimization for Cellular-Connected {UAV}s with Disconnectivity Constraint}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAV}s) has been increasing recently thanks to their enhanced functionalities and decreasing manufacturing costs. Many military and civilian applications involve {UAV}s for usecases/missions ranging from surveillance to search and rescue. However, despite their advantages, {UAV}s typically require near ubiquitous network connectivity for a successful fulfillment of their missions, which is a challenging task to achieve. In this paper, we study the trajectory optimization for cellular- connected {UAV}s with a disconnection duration constraint. That is, the {UAV} with the mission of flying from a start location to a final location needs to find a path during which it does not lose its cellular connection via one of the ground base stations (GBS) in the area more than a given time constraint. As the problem is difficult to be solved optimally, we propose a dynamic programming based approximate solution within polynomial time. In simulations, we show that the proposed approach can achieve close-to-optimal results with remarkably low computation costs and its accuracy could be increased by adding more granularity to the approximation.},

  abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of finding the optimal trajectory for an unmanned aerial vehicle ({UAV}) for improving the wireless coverage of a terrestrial cellular network. In particular, we consider a {UAV} that is tasked to travel from one point to another within a given time constraint, and it can also simultaneously assist the cellular network by providing wireless coverage during its mission. Considering an interference limited downlink of a cellular network, we formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the proportional-fair (PF) data rate of the cellular network and explore dynamic programming (DP) technique for finding the optimum {UAV} trajectory. We also explore the optimal {UAV} trajectories associated with maximum sum-rate and 5th percentile spectral efficiency (5pSE) rate and compare the capacity and coverage performance of the three approaches. Numerical simulations show that the maximum sum-rate trajectory provides the best per user capacity whereas, the optimal PF trajectory yields higher coverage probability than the other two trajectories. The optimal trajectories are generally infeasible to follow exactly as the {UAV}s can not take sharp turns due to kinematic constraints. Hence, we generate smooth trajectories using Bezier curve.},

A {UAV} collects data from a set of randomly distributed sensors, where both the locations of these sensors and their data volume to be transmitted are unknown to the {UAV}. In order to assist the {UAV} in finding the optimal motion trajectory in the face of the uncertainty without the above knowledge whilst aiming for maximizing the cumulative collected data, we formulate a reinforcement learning problem by modelling the motion-trajectory as a Markov decision process with the {UAV} acting as the learning agent. Then, we propose a pair of novel trajectory optimization algorithms based on stochastic modelling and reinforcement learning, which allows the {UAV} to optimize its flight trajectory without the need for system identification. More specifically, by dividing the considered region into small tiles, we conceive state-action-reward-state-action (Sarsa) and Q-learning based {UAV}-trajectory optimization algorithms (i.e., SUTOA and QUTOA) aiming to maximize the cumulative data collected during the finite flight-time. Our simulation results demonstrate that both of the proposed approaches are capable of finding an optimal trajectory under the flight-time constraint. The preference for QUTOA vs. SUTOA depends on the relative position of the start and the end points of the {UAV}s.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3001752},  ISSN={2169-3536},  month={},}

In this paper, assuming that the {UAV} flies horizontally with a fixed altitude, we study energy-efficient {UAV} communication with a ground terminal via optimizing the {UAV}'s trajectory, a new design paradigm that jointly considers both the communication throughput and the {UAV}'s energy consumption. To this end, we first derive a theoretical model on the propulsion energy consumption of fixed-wing {UAV}s as a function of the {UAV}'s flying speed, direction, and acceleration. Based on the derived model and by ignoring the radiation and signal processing energy consumption, the energy efficiency of {UAV} communication is defined as the total information bits communicated normalized by the {UAV} propulsion energy consumed for a finite time horizon. For the case of unconstrained trajectory optimization, we show that both the rate-maximization and energy-minimization designs lead to vanishing energy efficiency and thus are energy-inefficient in general. Next, we introduce a simple circular {UAV} trajectory, under which the {UAV}'s flight radius and speed are jointly optimized to maximize the energy efficiency. Furthermore, an efficient design is proposed for maximizing the {UAV}'s energy efficiency with general constraints on the trajectory, including its initial/final locations and velocities, as well as minimum/maximum speed and acceleration. Numerical results show that the proposed designs achieve significantly higher energy efficiency for {UAV} communication as compared with other benchmark schemes.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/TWC.2017.2688328},  ISSN={1558-2248},  month={June},}

This paper addresses the issue of physical-layer security in a {UAV} communication system, where a {UAV} sends confidential information to a legitimate receiver in the presence of a potential eavesdropper which are both on the ground. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate of the system by jointly optimizing the {UAV}'s trajectory and transmit power over a finite horizon. In contrast to the existing literature on wireless security with static nodes, we exploit the mobility of the {UAV} in this paper to enhance the secrecy rate via a new trajectory design. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve the problem efficiently, based on the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization methods. Specifically, the {UAV}'s transmit power and trajectory are each optimized with the other fixed in an alternating manner until convergence. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the secrecy rate of the {UAV} communication system, as compared to benchmark schemes without transmit power control or trajectory optimization.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254971},  ISSN={},  month={Dec},}

For {UAV}-enabled wireless communications, one of the main use cases is {UAV} relaying, where {UAV}s are deployed as flying relays in the sky to provide wireless connections between distant users that do not have reliable direct connectivity. This paper considers a general multiple {UAV} relaying system, where the information from a source node to a destination node is forwarded through multi-hop {UAV} relays. We aim to maximize the end-to-end throughput via joint {UAV} trajectory and transmit power optimization, subject to {UAV} mobility and collision avoidance constraints, the information-causality constraints, and the average and peak transmit power constraints of the source and {UAV} relays. The formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve, hence we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution based on the alternating maximization and successive convex optimization techniques.

In this paper, we first provide an overview on the two main research paradigms in cellular {UAV} communications, namely, cellular-enabled {UAV} communication with {UAV}s as new aerial users served by the ground base stations (GBSs), and {UAV}-assisted cellular communication with {UAV}s as new aerial communication platforms serving the terrestrial users. Then, we focus on the former paradigm and study a new {UAV} trajectory design problem subject to practical communication connectivity constraints with the GBSs. Specifically, we consider a cellular-connected {UAV} in the mission of flying from an initial location to a final location that are given, during which it needs to maintain reliable communication with the cellular network by associating with one of the available GBSs at each time instant that has the best line-of-sight channel (or shortest distance) with it. We aim to minimize the {UAV}'s mission completion time by optimizing its trajectory, subject to a quality-of-connectivity constraint of the GBS-{UAV} link specified by a minimum receive signal-to-noise ratio target, which needs to be satisfied throughout its mission. To tackle this challenging non-convex optimization problem, we first propose an efficient method to verify its feasibility via checking the connectivity between two given vertices on an equivalent graph. Next, by examining the GBS-{UAV} association sequence over time, we obtain useful structural results on the optimal {UAV} trajectory, based on which two efficient methods are proposed to find high-quality approximate trajectory solutions by leveraging the techniques from graph theory and convex optimization. The proposed methods are analytically shown to be capable of achieving a flexible tradeoff between complexity and performance, and yielding a solution in polynomial time with the performance arbitrarily close to that of the optimal solution. Numerical results further validate the effectiveness of our proposed designs against benchmark schemes. Finally, we make concluding remarks and point out promising directions for future work.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2880468},  ISSN={1558-0857},  month={March},}

   abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning model that preserves data privacy in the training process. Specifically, FL brings the model directly to the user equipments (UEs) for local training, where an edge server periodically collects the trained parameters to produce an improved model and sends it back to the UEs. However, since communication usually occurs through a limited spectrum, only a portion of the UEs can update their parameters upon each global aggregation. As such, new scheduling algorithms have to be engineered to facilitate the full implementation of FL. In this paper, based on a metric termed the age of update (AoU), we propose a scheduling policy by jointly accounting for the staleness of the received parameters and the instantaneous channel qualities to improve the running efficiency of FL. The proposed algorithm has low complexity and its effectiveness is demonstrated by Monte Carol simulations.},

   abstract = {This paper studies unmanned aerial vehicle ({UAV})-enabled wireless communication, where a rotary-wing {UAV} is dispatched to communicate with multiple ground nodes (GNs). We aim to minimize the total {UAV} energy consumption, including both propulsion energy and communication related energy, while satisfying the communication throughput requirement of each GN. To this end, we first derive a closed-form propulsion power consumption model for rotary-wing {UAV}s, and then formulate the energy minimization problem by jointly optimizing the {UAV} trajectory and communication time allocation among GNs, as well as the total mission completion time. The problem is difficult to be optimally solved, as it is non-convex and involves infinitely many variables over time. To tackle this problem, we first consider the simple fly-hover-communicate design, where the {UAV} successively visits a set of hovering locations and communicates with one corresponding GN while hovering at each location. For this design, we propose an efficient algorithm to optimize the hovering locations and durations, as well as the flying trajectory connecting these hovering locations, by leveraging the travelling salesman problem with neighborhood and convex optimization techniques. Next, we consider the general case, where the {UAV} also communicates while flying. We propose a new path discretization method to transform the original problem into a discretized equivalent with a finite number of optimization variables, for which we obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution by applying the successive convex approximation technique. The numerical results show that the proposed designs significantly outperform the benchmark schemes.},

In this paper, we study energy-efficient {UAV} communication with a ground terminal via optimizing the {UAV}'s trajectory, a new design paradigm that jointly considers both the communication throughput and the {UAV}'s energy consumption. To this end, we first derive a theoretical model on the propulsion energy consumption of fixed-wing {UAV}s as a function of the {UAV}'s flying speed, direction and acceleration, based on which the energy efficiency of {UAV} communication is defined. Then, for the case of unconstrained trajectory optimization, we show that both the rate-maximization and energy-minimization designs lead to vanishing energy efficiency and thus are energy-inefficient in general. Next, we introduce a practical circular {UAV} trajectory, under which the {UAV}'s flight radius and speed are optimized to maximize the energy efficiency for communication. Furthermore, an efficient design is proposed for maximizing the {UAV}'s energy efficiency with general constraints on its trajectory, including its initial/final locations and velocities, as well as maximum speed and acceleration. Numerical results show that the proposed designs achieve significantly higher energy efficiency for {UAV} communication as compared with other benchmark schemes.},

@article{Scutari2018,
   abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in parallel and distributed optimization methods for large-scale systems. In particular, nonconvex large-scale optimization problems have found a wide range of applications in several engineering fields. The design and the analysis of such complex, large-scale, systems pose several challenges and call for the development of new optimization models and algorithms. The major contribution of this paper is to put forth a general, unified, algorithmic framework, based on Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) techniques, for the parallel and distributed solution of a general class of non-convex constrained (non-separable, networked) problems. The presented framework unifies and generalizes several existing SCA methods, making them appealing for a parallel/distributed implementation while offering a flexible selection of function approximants, step size schedules, and control of the computation/communication efficiency. This paper is organized according to the lectures that one of the authors delivered at the CIME Summer School on Centralized and Distributed Multi-agent Optimization Models and Algorithms, held in Cetraro, Italy, June 23--27, 2014. These lectures are: I) Successive Convex Approximation Methods: Basics; II) Parallel Successive Convex Approximation Methods; and III) Distributed Successive Convex Approximation Methods.},
