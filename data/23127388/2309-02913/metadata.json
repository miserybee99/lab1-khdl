  "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of Age-of-Information (AoI) in UAV-assisted\nnetworks. Our objective is to minimize the expected AoI across devices by\noptimizing UAVs' stopping locations and device selection probabilities. To\ntackle this problem, we first derive a closed-form expression of the expected\nAoI that involves the probabilities of selection of devices. Then, we formulate\nthe problem as a non-convex minimization subject to quality of service\nconstraints. Since the problem is challenging to solve, we propose an Ensemble\nDeep Neural Network (EDNN) based approach which takes advantage of the dual\nformulation of the studied problem. Specifically, the Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) in the ensemble are trained in an unsupervised manner using the\nLagrangian function of the studied problem. Our experiments show that the\nproposed EDNN method outperforms traditional DNNs in reducing the expected AoI,\nachieving a remarkable reduction of $29.5\\%$.",
