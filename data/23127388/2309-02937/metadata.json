  "abstract": "We present a solution for locating the source, or maximum, of an unknown\nscalar field using a swarm of mobile robots. Unlike relying on the traditional\ngradient information, the swarm determines an ascending direction to approach\nthe source with arbitrary precision. The ascending direction is calculated from\nmeasurements of the field strength at the robot locations and their relative\npositions concerning the centroid. Rather than focusing on individual robots,\nwe focus the analysis on the density of robots per unit area to guarantee a\nmore resilient swarm, i.e., the functionality remains even if individuals go\nmissing or are misplaced during the mission. We reinforce the robustness of the\nalgorithm by providing sufficient conditions for the swarm shape so that the\nascending direction is almost parallel to the gradient. The swarm can respond\nto an unexpected environment by morphing its shape and exploiting the existence\nof multiple ascending directions. Finally, we validate our approach numerically\nwith hundreds of robots. The fact that a large number of robots always\ncalculate an ascending direction compensates for the loss of individuals and\nmitigates issues arising from the actuator and sensor noises.",
