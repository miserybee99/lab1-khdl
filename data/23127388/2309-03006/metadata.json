  "abstract": "Solana has quickly emerged as a popular platform for building decentralized\napplications (DApps), such as marketplaces for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). A\nkey reason for its success are Solana's low transaction fees and high\nperformance, which is achieved in part due to its stateless programming model.\nAlthough the literature features extensive tooling support for smart contract\nsecurity, current solutions are largely tailored for the Ethereum Virtual\nMachine. Unfortunately, the very stateless nature of Solana's execution\nenvironment introduces novel attack patterns specific to Solana requiring a\nrethinking for building vulnerability analysis methods.\n  In this paper, we address this gap and propose FuzzDelSol, the first\nbinary-only coverage-guided fuzzing architecture for Solana smart contracts.\nFuzzDelSol faithfully models runtime specifics such as smart contract\ninteractions. Moreover, since source code is not available for the large\nmajority of Solana contracts, FuzzDelSol operates on the contract's binary\ncode. Hence, due to the lack of semantic information, we carefully extracted\nlow-level program and state information to develop a diverse set of bug oracles\ncovering all major bug classes in Solana. Our extensive evaluation on 6049\nsmart contracts shows that FuzzDelSol's bug oracles find bugs with a high\nprecision and recall. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest\nevaluation of the security landscape on the Solana mainnet.",
