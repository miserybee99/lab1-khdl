  abstract  = "Solana is a rapidly-growing high-performance blockchain powered
               by a Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism and a novel
               stateless programming model that decouples code from data. With
               parallel execution on the PoH Sealevel runtime (instead of PoW),
               it achieves 100X-1000X speedups compared to Ethereum in terms of
               transactions per second. With the new programming model, new
               constraints (owner, signer, keys, bump seeds) and
               vulnerabilities (missing checks, overflows, type confusion,
               etc.) must be carefully verified to ensure the security of
               Solana smart contracts. This paper proposes VRust, the first
               automated smart contract vulnerability detection framework for
               Solana. A key technical novelty is a set of static analysis
               rules for validating untrustful input accounts that are unique
               in the Solana programming model. We have developed a total of
               eight different vulnerability types, and VRust is able to check
               all of them fully automatically by translating source code into
               Rust MIR-based inference rules without any code annotations.
               VRust has been evaluated on over a hundred of Solana projects,
               and it has revealed 12 previously unknown vulnerabilities,
               including 3 critical vulnerabilities in the official Solana
               Programming Library confirmed by core developers.",

  abstract  = "Ethereum has emerged as the most popular smart contract
               platform, with hundreds of thousands of contracts stored on the
               blockchain and covering diverse application scenarios, such as
               auctions, trading platforms, or elections. Given the financial
               nature of smart contracts, security vulnerabilities may lead to
               catastrophic consequences and, even worse, can hardly be fixed
               as data stored on the blockchain, including the smart contract
               code itself, are immutable. An automated security analysis of
               these contracts is thus of utmost interest, but at the same time
               technically challenging. This is as e.g., Ethereum's
               transaction-oriented programming mechanisms feature a subtle
               semantics, and since the blockchain data at execution time,
               including the code of callers and callees, are not statically
               known. In this work, we present eThor, the first sound and
               automated static analyzer for EVM bytecode, which is based on an
               abstraction of the EVM bytecode semantics based on Horn clauses.
               In particular, our static analysis supports reachability
               properties, which we show to be sufficient for capturing
               interesting security properties for smart contracts (e.g.,
               single-entrancy) as well as contract-specific functional
               properties. Our analysis is proven sound against a complete
               semantics of EVM bytecode, and a large-scale experimental
               evaluation on real-world contracts demonstrates that eThor is
               practical and outperforms the state-of-the-art static analyzers:
               specifically, eThor is the only one to provide soundness
               guarantees, terminates on 94\% of a representative set of
               real-world contracts, and achieves an F-measure (which combines
               sensitivity and specificity) of 89\%.",

               the blockchain is also playing an increasingly important role in
               decentralized application scenarios. Therefore, the automatic
               detection of security vulnerabilities in smart contracts has
               become an urgent problem in the application of blockchain
               technology. Hyperledger Fabric is a smart contract platform

               technology of Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts is still in its
