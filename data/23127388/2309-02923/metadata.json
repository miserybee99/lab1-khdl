  "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to computing vector road maps from\nsatellite remotely sensed images, building upon a well-defined Patched Line\nSegment (PaLiS) representation for road graphs that holds geometric\nsignificance. Unlike prevailing methods that derive road vector representations\nfrom satellite images using binary masks or keypoints, our method employs line\nsegments. These segments not only convey road locations but also capture their\norientations, making them a robust choice for representation. More precisely,\ngiven an input image, we divide it into non-overlapping patches and predict a\nsuitable line segment within each patch. This strategy enables us to capture\nspatial and structural cues from these patch-based line segments, simplifying\nthe process of constructing the road network graph without the necessity of\nadditional neural networks for connectivity. In our experiments, we demonstrate\nhow an effective representation of a road graph significantly enhances the\nperformance of vector road mapping on established benchmarks, without requiring\nextensive modifications to the neural network architecture. Furthermore, our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 6 GPU hours of training,\nleading to a substantial 32-fold reduction in training costs in terms of GPU\nhours.",
