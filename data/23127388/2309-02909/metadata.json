  "abstract": "Controlling ultrafast material transformations with atomic precision is\nessential for future nanotechnology. Pulsed laser annealing (LA), inducing\nextremely rapid and localized phase transitions, is a powerful way to achieve\nthis, but it requires careful optimization together with the appropriate system\ndesign. We present a multiscale LA computational framework able to simulate\natom-by-atom the highly out-of-equilibrium kinetics of a material as it\ninteracts with the laser, including effects of structural disorder. By\nseamlessly coupling a macroscale continuum solver to a nanoscale super-lattice\nKinetic Monte Carlo code, this method overcomes the limits of state-of-the-art\ncontinuum-based tools. We exploit it to investigate nontrivial changes in\ncomposition, morphology and quality of laser-annealed SiGe alloys. Validations\nagainst experiments and phase-field simulations, as well as advanced\napplications to strained, defected, nanostructured and confined SiGe are\npresented, highlighting the importance of a multiscale atomistic-continuum\napproach. Current applicability and potential generalization routes are finally\ndiscussed.",
