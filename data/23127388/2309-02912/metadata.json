  "abstract": "Detection of hate speech has been formulated as a standalone application of\nNLP and different approaches have been adopted for identifying the target\ngroups, obtaining raw data, defining the labeling process, choosing the\ndetection algorithm, and evaluating the performance in the desired setting.\nHowever, unlike other downstream tasks, hate speech suffers from the lack of\nlarge-sized, carefully curated, generalizable datasets owing to the highly\nsubjective nature of the task. In this paper, we first analyze the issues\nsurrounding hate speech detection through a data-centric lens. We then outline\na holistic framework to encapsulate the data creation pipeline across seven\nbroad dimensions by taking the specific example of hate speech towards sexual\nminorities. We posit that practitioners would benefit from following this\nframework as a form of best practice when creating hate speech datasets in the\nfuture.",
