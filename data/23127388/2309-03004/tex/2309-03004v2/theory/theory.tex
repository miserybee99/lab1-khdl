\section{Gradiential Explanation of Activation Sparsity}\label{sec:theory}

\IfFileExists{theorems.aux}{\input{theorems.aux}}{}

Before starting the formal analysis of emergence of activation sparsity, we provide intuitive framework of our explanation. Slight architectural changes in MLPs, which ease theoretical analyses, are also already available under this intuitive illustration. Another radical change is proposed after more detailed analyses.
