  "abstract": "Constructing null models to test the significance of extracted information is\na crucial step in data analysis. In this work, we provide a uniformly\nsampleable null model of directed graphs with the same (or similar) number of\nsimplices in the flag complex, with the restriction of retaining the underlying\nundirected graph. We describe an MCMC-based algorithm to sample from this null\nmodel and statistically investigate the mixing behaviour. This is paired with a\nhigh-performance, Rust-based, publicly available implementation. The motivation\ncomes from topological data analysis of connectomes in neuroscience. In\nparticular, we answer the fundamental question: are the high Betti numbers\nobserved in the investigated graphs evidence of an interesting topology, or are\nthey merely a byproduct of the high numbers of simplices? Indeed, by applying\nour new tool on the connectome of C. Elegans and parts of the statistical\nreconstructions of the Blue Brain Project, we find that the Betti numbers\nobserved are considerable statistical outliers with respect to this new null\nmodel. We thus, for the first time, statistically confirm that topological data\nanalysis in microscale connectome research is extracting statistically\nmeaningful information.",
