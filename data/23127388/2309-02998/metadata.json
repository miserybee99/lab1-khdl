  "abstract": "In this paper we consider the filtering of a class of partially observed\npiecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs). In particular, we assume that\nan ordinary differential equation (ODE) drives the deterministic element and\ncan only be solved numerically via a time discretization. We develop, based\nupon the approach in [20], a new particle and multilevel particle filter (MLPF)\nin order to approximate the filter associated to the discretized ODE. We\nprovide a bound on the mean square error associated to the MLPF which provides\nguidance on setting the simulation parameter of that algorithm and implies that\nsignificant computational gains can be obtained versus using a particle filter.\nOur theoretical claims are confirmed in several numerical examples.",
