  "abstract": "We highlight the role played by the unphysical phases in the definition of\nneutrino mass matrix, showing it does not relate to mere semantics, rather it\nhas an effect on the phenomenology. As a case study, we take the neutrino mass\nmatrix texture characterized by a vanishing trace, and study the effect of the\nphases, physical and unphysical, in its definition. We undergo a thorough\nphenomenological analysis, first (second) when the unphysical (CP) phases are\nvanishing, then move on to the general case where all phases exist. We stress\nthat the effect of the unphysical phases on the phenomenology originates from\nchanging the texture definition upon introducing them, while they are not\nobservable. Finally we present a theoretical realization of the texture based\non $A_5$ non-abelian flavor symmetry, which is also related to a consistently\ndefined texture.",
