  "abstract": "We revisit the Yilmaz Exponential Metric (YEM), which was recently shown to\ndescribe a traversable wormhole, and construct an axially symmetric\ngeneralization strictly within the framework of general relativity. Starting\nfrom a deformed spherically symmetric ansatz, we introduce a two-parameter\nfamily of Axially Symmetric Exponential Metric (ASEM) solutions that smoothly\ninterpolate between the YEM and the Curzon-Chazy spacetime geometry.",
