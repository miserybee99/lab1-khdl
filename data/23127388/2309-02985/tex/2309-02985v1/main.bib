abstract = {Considerable research has focused on the problems that end users face when programming software, in order to help them overcome their difficulties, but there is little research into the problems that arise in physical computing when end users construct circuits and program them. In an empirical study, we observed end-user developers as they connected a temperature sensor to an Arduino microcontroller and visualized its readings using LEDs. We investigated how many problems participants encountered, the problem locations, and whether they were overcome. We show that most fatal faults were due to incorrect circuit construction, and that often problems were wrongly diagnosed as program bugs. Whereas there are development environments that help end users create and debug software, there is currently little analogous support for physical computing tasks. Our work is a first step towards building appropriate tools that support end-user developers in overcoming obstacles when constructing physical computing artifacts.},

The framework allows scaling from a pure physical testbed to a simulated environment using a number of predefined modules and elements to simulate an IoT device or part of the tested infrastructure.

In this paper, we first present a set of open-source mock IoT applications along with the necessary infrastructure specifically designed to emulate a real IoT system. With our app set, users can add their own applications, automation rules, and communication flows with little technical effort, and test different scenarios to reproduce bugs that are not specific to the use of a single device. Second, we describe a functional testing framework for the IoT that is inspired by behavior-driven development (BDD), a testing methodology that serves as a proof-of-concept for how the application set can be used in different test scenarios. The application set and the functional testing framework are independent of each other. Our goal is to help IoT developers and testers find new testing techniques and benchmarking them in a reproducible, comparable, and less biased environment. We believe that they form the basis for a better understanding of how to test systems composed of heterogeneous devices to find issues and vulnerabilities that arise mainly from their interaction and data persistence management.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications are exposed to harsh conditions due to factors such as device failure, network problems, or implausible sensor values. We investigate how the inherent encapsulation of component and connector (C&C) architectures can be used to develop and deploy reliable IoT applications. Existing C&C languages for the development of IoT applications mainly focus on the description of architectures and the distribution of components to IoT devices. Furthermore, related approaches often pollute the models with low-level implementation details, tying the models to a particular platform and making them harder to understand. In this paper, we introduce MontiThings, a C&C language offering automatic error handling capabilities and a clear separation between business logic and implementation details. The error-handling methods presented in this paper can make C&C-based IoT applications more reliable without cluttering the business logic with error-handling code that is time-consuming to develop and makes the models hard to understand, especially for non-experts.}

Many existing FT-support mechanisms in IoT are static, tightly coupled, inflexible implementations that struggle to adapt in dynamic IoT environments. This paper proposes Complex Patterns of Failure (CPoF), an approach to providing reactive and proactive FT using Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Machine Learning (ML). Error-detection strategies are defined as nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) and implemented via CEP systems. Reactive-FT support is monitored and learned from to train ML models that proactively handle imminent future occurrences of known errors. We evaluated CPoF on an indoor agriculture system with experiments that used time and error correlations to preempt battery-depletion failures. We trained predictive models to learn from reactive-FT support and provide preemptive error recovery.},

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) unleashes great opportunities to improve our way of living and working through a seamless and highly dynamic cooperation among heterogeneous things including both computer-based systems and physical objects. However, properly dealing with the design, development, deployment and runtime management of IoT applications means to provide solutions for a multitude of challenges related to intelligent distributed systems within the IoT. In this paper we propose Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) as a keyenabler for applications running on intelligent distributed IoT systems. MDE helps in tackling challenges and supporting the lifecycle of such systems. Specifically, we introduce MDE4IoT, an MDE approach enabling the modelling of things and supporting intelligence as self-adaptation of Emergent Configurations in the IoT. Moreover, we show how MDE, and in particular MDE4IoT, can help in tackling several challenges by providing the Smart Street Lights concrete case.",

	abstract = {In recent years, various concepts, methodologies, and tools have emerged to tackle the complexity of multi-paradigm systems using model-driven engineering (MDE) to improve the usability, precision and automation of these systems. Previously, we proposed a process model for the development of Wireless Sensor Networkbased IoT (Internet of Things) Systems. Explicit modelling of the process paves the way for automation, analysis and optimization of the engineering process. In this exemplar paper, we use and extend a model traceability framework to orchestrate and analyze WSN-based IoT Systems. Traceability information is generated by automatically enacting the WSN-based IoT development process, thus enabling origin tracking and change impact analysis of these systems.},
