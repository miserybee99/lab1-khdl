  "abstract": "IoT systems complexity and susceptibility to failures pose significant\nchallenges in ensuring their reliable operation Failures can be internally\ngenerated or caused by external factors impacting both the systems correctness\nand its surrounding environment To investigate these complexities various\nmodeling approaches have been proposed to raise the level of abstraction\nfacilitating automation and analysis FailureLogic Analysis FLA is a technique\nthat helps predict potential failure scenarios by defining how a components\nfailure logic behaves and spreads throughout the system However manually\nspecifying FLA rules can be arduous and errorprone leading to incomplete or\ninaccurate specifications In this paper we propose adopting testing\nmethodologies to improve the completeness and correctness of these rules How\nfailures may propagate within an IoT system can be observed by systematically\ninjecting failures while running test cases to collect evidence useful to add\ncomplete and refine FLA rules",
