  "abstract": "The launch of the Fermi satellite in 2008, with its Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) on board, has opened a new era for the study of gamma-ray sources at GeV\n($10^9$ eV) energies. Similarly, the commissioning of the third generation of\nimaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) - H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS\n- in the mid-2000's has firmly established the field of TeV ($10^{12}$ eV)\ngamma-ray astronomy. Together, these instruments have revolutionised our\nunderstanding of the high-energy gamma-ray sky, and they continue to provide\naccess to it over more than six decades in energy. In recent years, the\nground-level particle detector arrays HAWC, Tibet, and LHAASO have opened a new\nwindow to gamma rays of the highest energies, beyond 100 TeV. Soon,\nnext-generation facilities such as CTA and SWGO will provide even better\nsensitivity, thus promising a bright future for the field. In this chapter, we\nprovide a brief overview of methods commonly employed for the analysis of\ngamma-ray data, focusing on those used for Fermi-LAT and IACT observations. We\ndescribe the standard data formats, explain event reconstruction and selection\nalgorithms, and cover in detail high-level analysis approaches for imaging and\nextraction of spectra, including aperture photometry as well as advanced\nlikelihood techniques.",
