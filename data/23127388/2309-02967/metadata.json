  "abstract": "Data charts are prevalent across various fields due to their efficacy in\nconveying complex data relationships. However, static charts may sometimes\nstruggle to engage readers and efficiently present intricate information,\npotentially resulting in limited understanding. We introduce \"Live Charts,\" a\nnew format of presentation that decomposes complex information within a chart\nand explains the information pieces sequentially through rich animations and\naccompanying audio narration. We propose an automated approach to revive static\ncharts into Live Charts. Our method integrates GNN-based techniques to analyze\nthe chart components and extract data from charts. Then we adopt large natural\nlanguage models to generate appropriate animated visuals along with a\nvoice-over to produce Live Charts from static ones. We conducted a thorough\nevaluation of our approach, which involved the model performance, use cases, a\ncrowd-sourced user study, and expert interviews. The results demonstrate Live\nCharts offer a multi-sensory experience where readers can follow the\ninformation and understand the data insights better. We analyze the benefits\nand drawbacks of Live Charts over static charts as a new information\nconsumption experience.",
