  "abstract": "In this paper, we study functional approximations where we choose the\nso-called radial basis function method and more specifically,\nquasi-interpolation. From the various available approaches to the latter, we\nform new quasi-Lagrange functions when the orders of the singularities of the\nradial function's Fourier transforms at zero do not match the parity of the\ndimension of the space, and therefore new expansions and coefficients are\nneeded to overcome this problem. We develop explicit constructions of infinite\nFourier expansions that provide these coefficients and make an extensive\ncomparison of the approximation qualities and - with a particular focus -\npolynomial precision and uniform approximation order of the various formulae.\nOne of the interesting observations concerns the link between algebraic\nconditions of expansion coefficients and analytic properties of localness and\nconvergence.",
