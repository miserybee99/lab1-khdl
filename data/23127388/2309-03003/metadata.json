  "abstract": "The aim of this study is to present proofs for new theorems. Basic thoughts\nof new definitions emerge from the decision-making under uncertainty in\neconomics and finance. Shape of the certain utility curve is central to\nstandard definitions in determining risk attitudes of investors. Shape alone\ndetermines risk behavior of investors in standard theory. Although the terms\nrisk-averse, risk-loving, and risk-neutral are equivalent to strict concavity,\nstrict convexity, and linearity, respectively, in standard theory, strict\nconcavity or strict convexity, or linearity are valid for certain new\ndefinitions. The connection between the curvature of utility curve and risk\nattitude is broken for the new definitions. For instance, convex utility curve\nmay show risk-averse behavior under new definitions. Additionally, this paper\nhas proved that new definitions are richer than standard ones when shape is\nconsidered. Hence, it can be stated that new definitions are broader than\nstandard definitions from the viewpoint of shape. With all of these, it has\nbeen demonstrated that the theorems and proofs in this study extend the\nstandard utility theory in an important way.",
