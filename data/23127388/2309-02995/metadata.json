  "abstract": "Uncertainty-based deep learning models have attracted a great deal of\ninterest for their ability to provide accurate and reliable predictions.\nEvidential deep learning stands out achieving remarkable performance in\ndetecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data with a single deterministic neural\nnetwork. Motivated by this fact, in this paper we propose the integration of an\nevidential deep learning method into a continual learning framework in order to\nperform simultaneously incremental object classification and OOD detection.\nMoreover, we analyze the ability of vacuity and dissonance to differentiate\nbetween in-distribution data belonging to old classes and OOD data. The\nproposed method, called CEDL, is evaluated on CIFAR-100 considering two\nsettings consisting of 5 and 10 tasks, respectively. From the obtained results,\nwe could appreciate that the proposed method, in addition to provide comparable\nresults in object classification with respect to the baseline, largely\noutperforms OOD detection compared to several posthoc methods on three\nevaluation metrics: AUROC, AUPR and FPR95.",
