  "abstract": "We study the effect of stochastic feeding costs on animal-based commodities\nwith particular focus on aquaculture. More specifically, we use soybean futures\nto infer on the stochastic behaviour of salmon feed, which we assume to follow\na Schwartz-2-factor model. We compare the decision of harvesting salmon using a\ndecision rule assuming either deterministic or stochastic feeding costs, i.e.\nincluding feeding cost risk. We identify cases, where accounting for stochastic\nfeeding costs leads to significant improvements as well as cases where\ndeterministic feeding costs are a good enough proxy. Nevertheless, in all of\nthese cases, the newly derived rules show superior performance, while the\nadditional computational costs are negligible. From a methodological point of\nview, we demonstrate how to use Deep-Neural-Networks to infer on the decision\nboundary that determines harvesting or continuation, improving on more\nclassical regression-based and curve-fitting methods. To achieve this we use a\ndeep classifier, which not only improves on previous results but also scales\nwell for higher dimensional problems, and in addition mitigates effects due to\nmodel uncertainty, which we identify in this article. effects due to model\nuncertainty, which we identify in this article.",
