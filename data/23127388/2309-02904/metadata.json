  "abstract": "We calculate the total Born cross section of the $e^+e^-$-pair production by\nan electron in the field of a nucleus (trident process) using the modern\nmultiloop methods. For general energies we obtain the cross section in terms of\nconverging power series. The threshold asymptotics and the high-energy\nasymptotics are obtained analytically. In particular, we obtain additional\ncontribution to the Racah formula due to the identity of the final electrons.\nBesides, our result for the leading term of the high-energy asymptotics reveals\na typo in an old Racah paper [Racah1937].",
