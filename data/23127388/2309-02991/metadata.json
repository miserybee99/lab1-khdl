  "abstract": "Absolute cross sections measured using electromagnetic devices to separate\nand detect heavy recoiling ions need to be corrected for charge state\nfractions. Accurate prediction of charge state distributions using theoretical\nmodels is not always a possibility, especially in energy and mass regions where\ndata is sparse. As such, it is often necessary to measure charge state\nfractions directly. In this paper we present a novel method of using a\nscintillation screen along with a CMOS camera to image the charge dispersed\nbeam after a set of magnetic dipoles. A measurement of the charge state\ndistribution for 88Sr passing through a natural carbon foil is performed. Using\na Bayesian model to extract statistically meaningful uncertainties from these\nimages, we find agreement between the new method and a more traditional method\nusing Faraday cups. Future work is need to better understand systematic\nuncertainties. Our technique offers a viable method to measure charge state\ndistributions.",
