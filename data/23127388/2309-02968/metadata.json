  "abstract": "The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is known to suffer from the phenomenon of\n\\textit{posterior collapse}, where the latent representations generated by the\nmodel become independent of the inputs. This leads to degenerated\nrepresentations of the input, which is attributed to the limitations of the\nVAE's objective function. In this work, we propose a novel solution to this\nissue, the Contrastive Regularization for Variational Autoencoders (CR-VAE).\nThe core of our approach is to augment the original VAE with a contrastive\nobjective that maximizes the mutual information between the representations of\nsimilar visual inputs. This strategy ensures that the information flow between\nthe input and its latent representation is maximized, effectively avoiding\nposterior collapse. We evaluate our method on a series of visual datasets and\ndemonstrate, that CR-VAE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in preventing\nposterior collapse.",
