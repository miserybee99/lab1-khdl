abstract = {We consider training a deep neural network to generate samples from an unknown distribution given i.i.d. data. We frame learning as an optimization minimizing a two-sample test statistic—informally speaking, a good generator network produces samples that cause a two-sample test to fail to reject the null hypothesis. As our two-sample test statistic, we use an unbiased estimate of the maximum mean discrepancy, which is the centerpiece of the nonparametric kernel two-sample test proposed by Gretton et al. [2]. We compare to the adversarial nets framework introduced by Goodfellow et al. [1], in which learning is a two-player game between a generator network and an adversarial discriminator network, both trained to outwit the other. From this perspective, the MMD statistic plays the role of the discriminator. In addition to empirical comparisons, we prove bounds on the generalization error incurred by optimizing the empirical MMD.},

title = "Generating sentences from a continuous space",
abstract = "The standard recurrent neural network language model (rnnlm) generates sentences one word at a time and does not work from an explicit global sentence representation. In this work, we introduce and study an rnn-based variational autoencoder generative model that incorporates distributed latent representations of entire sentences. This factorization allows it to explicitly model holistic properties of sentences such as style, topic, and high-level syntactic features. Samples from the prior over these sentence representations remarkably produce diverse and well-formed sentences through simple deterministic decoding. By examining paths through this latent space, we are able to generate coherent novel sentences that interpolate between known sentences. We present techniques for solving the difficult learning problem presented by this model, demonstrate its effectiveness in imputing missing words, explore many interesting properties of the model{\textquoteright}s latent sentence space, and present negative results on the use of the model in language modeling.",
