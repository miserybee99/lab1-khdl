He received the Dipl.-Ing. and Dr.techn. degrees from Vienna University of Technology, Austria, in 2002 and 2012, respectively. During his studies, he was involved in designing analog and digital linearization systems for power amplifiers and behavioral modeling of microwave circuits. His current research focuses on planning and implementing complex measurements, emphasizing calibration techniques and material characterization. Michael Gadringer has authored more than 20 journals and 50 conference papers. He was a member of the IEEE 1765 standard working group on the recommended practice for estimating the Error Vector Magnitude of digitally modulated signals. In addition, he is contributing to the IEEE P2822 working group on the recommended practice for Microwave, Millimeter-wave, and THz on-wafer calibrations, deembedding, and measurements.
