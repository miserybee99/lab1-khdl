  "abstract": "This paper proposes a new approach, the symmetric-reciprocal-match (SRM)\nmethod, for calibrating vector network analyzers (VNAs). The method involves\nusing multiple symmetric one-port loads, a two-port reciprocal device, and a\nmatched load. The load standards consist of two-port symmetric one-port\ndevices, and at least three unique loads are used. However, the specific\nimpedances of the loads are not specified. The reciprocal device can be any\ntransmissive device, although a non-reciprocal device can also be used if only\nthe one-port error boxes are of interest. The matched load is fully defined and\ncan be asymmetric. We numerically demonstrated the proposed method's accuracy\nwith synthetic data and with measurements of coaxial standards using a\ncommercial short-open-load-reciprocal (SOLR) calibration kit with verification\nstandards. An advantage of the proposed method is that only the match standard\nis defined, whereas the remaining standards are partially defined, either\nthrough symmetry or reciprocity.",
