  "abstract": "Facing with grave climate change and enormous energy demand, catalyzer gets\nmore and more important due to its significant effect on reducing fossil fuels\nconsumption. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction\n(OER) by water splitting are feasible ways to produce clean sustainable energy.\nHere we systematically explored atomic structures and related STM images of Se\ndefects in PtSe2. The equilibrium fractions of vacancies under variable\nconditions were detailly predicted. Besides, we found the vacancies are highly\nkinetic stable, without recovering or aggregation. The Se vacancies in PtSe2\ncan dramatically enhance the HER performance, comparing with, even better than\nPt(111). Beyond, we firstly revealed that PtSe2 monolayer with Se vacancies is\nalso a good OER catalyst. The excellent bipolar catalysis of Se vacancies were\nfurther confirmed by experimental measurements. We produced defective PtSe2 by\ndirect selenization of Pt foil at 773 K using a CVD process. Then we observed\nthe HER and OER performance of defective PtSe2 is much highly efficient than Pt\nfoils by a series of measurements. Our work with compelling theoretical and\nexperimental studies indicates PtSe2 with Se defects is an ideal bipolar\ncandidate for HER and OER.",
