  "abstract": "In the presence of the gravitational field, the energy density of matter no\nlonger coincides with its mass density. A discrepancy exists, of course, also\nbetween the associated power spectra. Within the $\\Lambda$CDM model, we derive\na formula that relates the power spectrum of the energy density to that of the\nmass density and test it with the help of N-body simulations run in comoving\nboxes of 2.816 Gpc/$h$. The results confirm the validity of the derived formula\nand simultaneously show that the power spectra diverge significantly from one\nanother at large cosmological scales.",
