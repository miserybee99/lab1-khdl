  "abstract": "A multi-step extended maximum residual Kaczmarz method is presented for the\nsolution of the large inconsistent linear system of equations by using the\nmulti-step iterations technique. Theoretical analysis proves the proposed\nmethod is convergent and gives an upper bound on its convergence rate.\nNumerical experiments show that the proposed method is effective and\noutperforms the existing extended Kaczmarz methods in terms of the number of\niteration steps and the computational costs.",
