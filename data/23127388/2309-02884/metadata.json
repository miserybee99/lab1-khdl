  "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable adaptability,\nshowcasing their capacity to excel in tasks for which they were not explicitly\ntrained. However, despite their impressive natural language processing (NLP)\ncapabilities, effective alignment of LLMs remains a crucial challenge when\ndeploying them for specific clinical applications. The ability to generate\nresponses with factually accurate content and to engage in non-trivial\nreasoning steps are crucial for the LLMs to be eligible for applications in\nclinical medicine. Employing a combination of techniques including\ninstruction-tuning and in-prompt strategies like few-shot and chain-of-thought\nprompting has significantly enhanced the performance of LLMs. Our proposed\nalignment strategy for medical question-answering, known as\n'expand-guess-refine', offers a parameter and data-efficient solution. A\npreliminary analysis of this method demonstrated outstanding performance,\nachieving a score of 70.63% on a subset of questions sourced from the USMLE\ndataset.",
