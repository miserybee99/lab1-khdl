	abstract = {Background:
Infertility is a complex disorder with significant medical, psychological and economic problems.

Aims:
The aim of the study is to evaluate the structural abnormalities of the uterus and fallopian tubes in infertile women as elucidated by hysterosalpingography.

Setting and Design:
A retrospective study, conducted at the Radiology and Obstetric and Gynaecologic Departments of a tertiary health care institution.

Materials and Methods:
Evaluation of all consecutive patients in whom hysterosalpingographic ({HSG}) was performed for infertility between July 2013 and June 2015 in the Department of Radiology. For the biodata, indications for the investigation and the {HSG} findings were obtained.

Statistical Analysis:
The data were analyzed using {IBM} Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ({SPSS} Inc., Chicago, {IL}, {USA}) for Windows, version 20 software.

Results:
A total of 299 patients were evaluated. Of these, 250 were for infertility with primary and secondary infertility constituting 18.4 and 81.6\%, respectively. Seventy percent of the cases for infertility had abnormalities on the {HSG}. Normal uterine cavity was found in 123 (49.2\%) cases. Uterine filling defects were the most common uterine abnormality. Fallopian tube occlusion, loculated contrast material spillage and hydrosalpinx were more common on the right, and bilateral tubal occlusion was seen only in 11.2\%. All cases of intravasation were associated with either unilateral or bilateral fallopian tube blockage or irregularity of the uterus.

Conclusion:
There was a high incidence of tubal disease in the women presenting with infertility. This was commonly as a result of infection and inflammatory process. This study showed that {HSG} is very vital in detecting birth canal pathologies; hence, the facility for this important procedure, especially fluoroscopy, should be made available in the health centres for adequate assessment of the women with infertility.},

Based upon an iterative process of decision making, a task force of the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups recommends that the diagnosis of gestational diabetes be made when any of the following 3 75-g, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test thresholds are met or exceeded: fasting 92 mg/{dL}, 1-hour 180 mg/{dL}, or 2 hours 153 mg/{dL}.

We explored if a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test ({OGTT}) at 14–16 weeks of gestation could identify women who will (1) develop {GDM} or give birth to large-for-gestational-age ({LGA}) babies in 1031 pregnant women from the {STORK} study using different diagnostic criteria ({WHO}1999, {IADPSG}2010, {WHO}2013, {NORWAY}2017) and (2) develop pre-diabetes 5 years postpartum focusing on first trimester β-cell function in a separate study of 300 women from the {STORK} cohort. The sensitivity of the 14–16 week {OGTT} to identify women who would develop {GDM} or have {LGA} babies was low, and we could not identify alternative cut-offs to exclude women not at risk or identify women that could benefit from early intervention. First trimester β-cell function was a stronger determinant than third trimester β-cell function of predicting maternal pre-diabetes. In conclusion, in our normal low-risk population, the 75 g {OGTT} at 14–16 weeks is insufficient to identify candidates for early treatment of {GDM} or identify women not likely to develop {GDM} or have {LGA} babies. First trimester β-cell function may predict pre-diabetes 5 years postpartum.},

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study ({GBD}) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{GBD} estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost ({YLLs}), years lived with disability ({YLDs}), and disability-adjusted life-years ({DALYs}) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories. Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources. Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the {GBD} population, fertility, and mortality estimates. Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate {YLLs}. A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, {DisMod}-{MR} 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate {YLDs}. We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index ({SDI}), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years. Uncertainty intervals ({UIs}) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Global health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised {DALY} rates. After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of {DALYs} has remained stable. Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised {DALY} rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990–2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0–9-year age group. Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of {DALYs} in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth). In adolescents aged 10–24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of {DALYs}: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth). Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10–24 years were also in the top ten in the 25–49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), {HIV}/{AIDS} (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth). In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of {DALYs} in both the 50–74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups. Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to {YLDs} from non-communicable diseases and injuries. In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury {YLDs} constituted more than half of all disease burden. Decreases in age-standardised {DALY} rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the {SDI} range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher {SDI}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}As disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies. With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes. The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Locally weighted regression, or loess, is a way of estimating a regression surface through a multivariate smoothing procedure, fitting a function of the independent variables locally and in a moving fashion analogous to how a moving average is computed for a time series. With local fitting we can estimate a much wider class of regression surfaces than with the usual classes of parametric functions, such as polynomials. The goal of this article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced: (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of univariate locally weighted regression; (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares fitting of parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods that are useful tools for understanding loess estimates and checking the assumptions on which the estimation procedure is based; and (d) the M plot, an adaptation of Mallows's Cp procedure, which provides a graphical portrayal of the trade-off between variance and bias, and which can be used to choose the amount of smoothing.},

	abstract = {A distance matrix D of order n is symmetric with elements −12dij2, where dii=0. D is Euclidean when the 12n(n−1) quantities dij can be generated as the distances between a set of n points, X (n×p), in a Euclidean space of dimension p. The dimensionality of D is defined as the least value of p=rank(X) of any generating X; in general p+1 and p+2 are also acceptable but may include imaginary coordinates, even when D is Euclidean. Basic properties of Euclidean distance matrices are established; in particular, when ρ=rank(D) it is shown that, depending on whether {eTD}−e is not or is zero, the generating points lie in either p=ρ−1 dimensions, in which case they lie on a hypersphere, or in p=ρ−2 dimensions, in which case they do not. (The notation e is used for a vector all of whose values are one.) When D is non-Euclidean its dimensionality p=r+s will comprise r real and s imaginary columns of X, and (r, s) are invariant for all generating X of minimal rank. Higher-ranking representations can arise only from p+1=(r+1)+s or p+1=r+ (s+1) or p+2=(r+1)+(s+1), so that not only are r, s invariant, but they are both minimal for all admissible representations X.},

	abstract = {A new algorithm called Mersenne Twister ({MT}) is proposed for generating uniform pseudorandom numbers. For a particular choice of parameters, the algorithm provides a super astronomical period of 219937 −1 and 623-dimensional equidistribution up to 32-bit accuracy, while using a working area of only 624 words. This is a new variant of the previously proposed generators, {TGFSR}, modified so as to admit a Mersenne-prime period. The characteristic polynomial has many terms. The distribution up to v bits accuracy for 1 ≤ v ≤ 32 is also shown to be good. An algorithm is also given that checks the primitivity of the characteristic polynomial of {MT} with computational complexity O(p2) where p is the degree of the polynomial. We implemented this generator in portable C-code. It passed several stringent statistical tests, including diehard. Its speed is comparable to other modern generators. Its merits are due to the efficient algorithms that are unique to polynomial calculations over the two-element field.},

	abstract = {Recent analysis of early {COVID}-19 data from China showed that the number of confirmed cases followed a subexponential power-law increase, with a growth exponent of around 2.2 (Maier and Brockmann, 2020). The power-law behavior was attributed to a combination of effective containment and mitigation measures employed as well as behavioral changes by the population. In this work, we report a random walk Monte Carlo simulation study of proximity-based infection spread. Control interventions such as lockdown measures and mobility restrictions are incorporated in the simulations through a single parameter, the size of each step in the random walk process. The step size l is taken to be a multiple of 〈r〉, which is the average separation between individuals. Three temporal growth regimes (quadratic, intermediate power-law and exponential) are shown to emerge naturally from our simulations. For l=〈r〉, we get intermediate power-law growth exponents that are in general agreement with available data from China. On the other hand, we obtain a quadratic growth for smaller step sizes l≲〈r〉∕2, while for large l the growth is found to be exponential. We further performed a comparative case study of early fatality data (under varying levels of lockdown conditions) from three other countries, India, Brazil and South Africa. We show that reasonable agreement with these data can be obtained by incorporating small-world-like connections in our simulations.},

	abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) has now spread throughout most countries in the world causing heavy life losses and damaging social-economic impacts. Following a stochastic point process modelling approach, a Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to represent the {COVID}-19 spread dynamics. First, we examined various expected performances (theoretical properties) of the simulation model assuming a number of arbitrarily defined scenarios. Simulation studies were then performed on the real {COVID}-19 data reported (over the period of 1 March to 1 May) for Australia and United Kingdom ({UK}). Given the initial number of {COVID}-19 infection active cases were around 10 for both countries, the model estimated that the number of active cases would peak around 29 March in Australia (≈ 1,700 cases) and around 22 April in {UK} (≈ 22,860 cases); ultimately the total confirmed cases could sum to 6,790 for Australia in about 75 days and 206,480 for {UK} in about 105 days. The results of the estimated {COVID}-19 reproduction numbers were consistent with what was reported in the literature. This simulation model was considered an effective and adaptable decision making/what-if analysis tool in battling {COVID}-19 in the immediate need, and for modelling any other infectious diseases in the future.},

	abstract = {The U.S. with only 4\% of the world’s population, bears a disproportionate share of infections in the {COVID}-19 pandemic. To understand this puzzle, we investigate how mitigation strategies and compliance can work together (or in opposition) to reduce (or increase) the spread of {COVID}-19 infection. Building on the Oxford index, we create state-specific stringency indices tailored to U.S. conditions, to measure the degree of strictness of public mitigation measures. A modified time-varying {SEIRD} model, incorporating this Stringency Index as well as a Compliance Indicator is then estimated with daily data for a sample of 6 U.S. states: New York, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, and Arizona. We provide a simple visual policy tool to evaluate the various combinations of mitigation policies and compliance that can reduce the basic reproduction number to less than one, the acknowledged threshold in the epidemiological literature to control the pandemic. Understanding of this relationship by both the public and policy makers is key to controlling the pandemic. This tool has the potential to be used in a real-time, dynamic fashion for flexible policy options. Our methodology can be applied to other countries and has the potential to be extended to other epidemiological models as well. With this first step in attempting to quantify the factors that go into the “black box” of the transmission factor β, we hope that our work will stimulate further research in the dual role of mitigation policies and compliance.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the effectiveness of the modelling approach on the pandemic due to the spreading of the novel {COVID}-19 disease and develop a susceptible-infected-removed ({SIR}) model that provides a theoretical framework to investigate its spread within a community. Here, the model is based upon the well-known susceptible-infected-removed ({SIR}) model with the difference that a total population is not defined or kept constant per se and the number of susceptible individuals does not decline monotonically. To the contrary, as we show herein, it can be increased in surge periods! In particular, we investigate the time evolution of different populations and monitor diverse significant parameters for the spread of the disease in various communities, represented by China, South Korea, India, Australia, {USA}, Italy and the state of Texas in the {USA}. The {SIR} model can provide us with insights and predictions of the spread of the virus in communities that the recorded data alone cannot. Our work shows the importance of modelling the spread of {COVID}-19 by the {SIR} model that we propose here, as it can help to assess the impact of the disease by offering valuable predictions. Our analysis takes into account data from January to June, 2020, the period that contains the data before and during the implementation of strict and control measures. We propose predictions on various parameters related to the spread of {COVID}-19 and on the number of susceptible, infected and removed populations until September 2020. By comparing the recorded data with the data from our modelling approaches, we deduce that the spread of {COVID}-19 can be under control in all communities considered, if proper restrictions and strong policies are implemented to control the infection rates early from the spread of the disease.},

	abstract = {Background Contact mixing plays a key role in the spread of {COVID}-19. Thus, mobility restrictions of varying degrees up to and including nationwide lockdowns have been implemented in over 200 countries. To appropriately target the timing, location, and severity of measures intended to encourage social distancing at a country level, it is essential to predict when and where outbreaks will occur, and how widespread they will be. Methods We analyze aggregated, anonymized health data and cell phone mobility data from Israel. We develop predictive models for daily new cases and the test positivity rate over the next 7 days for different geographic regions in Israel. We evaluate model goodness of fit using root mean squared error ({RMSE}). We use these predictions in a five-tier categorization scheme to predict the severity of {COVID}-19 in each region over the next week. We measure magnitude accuracy ({MA}), the extent to which the correct severity tier is predicted. Results Models using mobility data outperformed models that did not use mobility data, reducing {RMSE} by 17.3\% when predicting new cases and by 10.2\% when predicting the test positivity rate. The best set of predictors for new cases consisted of 1-day lag of past 7-day average new cases, along with a measure of internal movement within a region. The best set of predictors for the test positivity rate consisted of 3-days lag of past 7-day average test positivity rate, along with the same measure of internal movement. Using these predictors, {RMSE} was 4.812 cases per 100,000 people when predicting new cases and 0.79\% when predicting the test positivity rate. {MA} in predicting new cases was 0.775, and accuracy of prediction to within one tier was 1.0. {MA} in predicting the test positivity rate was 0.820, and accuracy to within one tier was 0.998. Conclusions Using anonymized, macro-level data human mobility data along with health data aids predictions of when and where {COVID}-19 outbreaks are likely to occur. Our method provides a useful tool for government decision makers, particularly in the post-vaccination era, when focused interventions are needed to contain {COVID}-19 outbreaks while mitigating the collateral damage from more global restrictions.},

People’s social behavior, reflected in their mobility data, plays a major role in spreading the disease. Therefore, we used the daily mobility data aggregated at the county level beside {COVID}-19 statistics and demographic information for short-term forecasting of {COVID}-19 outbreaks in the United States. The daily data are fed to a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) to predict the accumulated number of {COVID}-19 cases in the next two weeks. A significant average correlation was achieved (r=0.83 (p = 0.005)) between the model predicted and actual accumulated cases in the interval from August 1, 2020 until January 22, 2021. The model predictions had r {\textgreater} 0.7 for 87\% of the counties across the United States. A lower correlation was reported for the counties with total cases of {\textless}1000 during the test interval. The average mean absolute error ({MAE}) was 605.4 and decreased with a decrease in the total number of cases during the testing interval. The model was able to capture the effect of government responses on {COVID}-19 cases. Also, it was able to capture the effect of age demographics on the {COVID}-19 spread. It showed that the average daily cases decreased with a decrease in the retiree percentage and increased with an increase in the young percentage.

This approach uses simple and transparent statistical models to estimate the effect of {NPIs} on mobility, and basic machine learning methods to generate 10-day forecasts of {COVID}-19 cases. An advantage of the approach is that it involves minimal assumptions about disease dynamics, and requires only publicly-available data. We evaluate this approach using local and regional data from China, France, Italy, South Korea, and the United States, as well as national data from 80 countries around the world.

	abstract = {Many models for the spread of infectious diseases in populations have been analyzed math- ematically and applied to specific diseases. Threshold theorems involving the basic repro- duction number R0, the contact number σ, and the replacement number R are reviewed for the classic {SIR} epidemic and endemic models. Similar results with new expressions for R0 are obtained for {MSEIR} and {SEIR} endemic models with either continuous age or age groups. Values of R0 and σ are estimated for various diseases including measles in Niger and pertussis in the United States. Previous models with age structure, heterogeneity, and spatial structure are surveyed. 1. Introduction. The effectiveness of improved sanitation, antibiotics, and vac- cination programs created a confidence in the 1960s that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated. Consequently, chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer received more attention in the United States and industrialized countries. But infectious diseases have continued to be the major causes of suffering and mortality in developing countries. Moreover, infectious disease agents adapt and evolve, so that new infectious diseases have emerged and some existing diseases have reemerged (142). Newly identified diseases include Lyme disease (1975), Legionnaire's disease (1976), toxic-shock syndrome (1978), hepatitis C (1989), hepatitis E (1990), and hantavirus (1993). The human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}), which is the etiological agent for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ({AIDS}), emerged in 1981 and has become an important sexually transmitted disease throughout the world. Antibiotic-resistant strains of tuberculosis, pneumonia, and gonorrhea have evolved. Malaria, dengue, and yellow fever have reemerged and are spreading into new regions as climate changes occur. Diseases such as plague, cholera, and hemorrhagic fevers (Bolivian, Ebola, Lassa, Marburg, etc.) continue to erupt occasionally. Surprisingly, new infectious agents called prions have recently joined the previously known agents: viruses, bac- teria, protozoa, and helminths (worms). There is strong evidence that prions are the cause of spongiform encephalopathies, e.g., bovine spongiform encephalopathy ({BSE}, "mad cow disease"), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ({CJD}), kuru, and scrapie in sheep (168). Recent popular books have given us exciting accounts of the emergence and de- tection of new diseases (82, 168, 170, 183). It is clear that human or animal invasions},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	abstract = {The growing recognition that human diseases are molecularly heterogeneous has stimulated interest in the development of prognostic and predictive classifiers for patient selection and stratification. In the process of classifier development, it has been repeatedly emphasized that in situations where the number of candidate predictor variables is much larger than the number of observations, the apparent (training set, resubstitution) accuracy of the classifiers can be highly optimistically biased and hence, classification accuracy should be reported based on evaluation of the classifier on a separate test set or using complete cross-validation. Such evaluation methods have however not been the norm in the case of low-dimensional, p{\textless}n data that arise, for example, in clinical trials when a classifier is developed on a combination of clinico-pathological variables and a small number of genetic biomarkers selected from an understanding of the biology of the disease. We undertook simulation studies to investigate the existence and extent of the problem of overfitting with low-dimensional data. The results indicate that overfitting can be a serious problem even for low-dimensional data, especially if the relationship of outcome to the set of predictor variables is not strong. We hence encourage the adoption of either a separate test set or complete cross-validation to evaluate classifier accuracy, even when the number of candidate predictor variables is substantially smaller than the number of cases.},

Still, new work in local regression continues at a rapid pace. We review the history of local regression. We discuss four of its basic components that must be chosen in using local regression in practice — the weight function, the parametric family that is fitted locally, the bandwidth, and the assumptions about the distribution of the response. A major theme of the paper is that these choices represent a modeling of the data; different data sets deserve different choices. We describe polynomial mixing, a method for enlarging polynomial parametric families. We introduce an approach to adaptive fitting,assessment of parametric localization. We describe the use of this approach to design two adaptive procedures: one automatically chooses the mixing degree of mixing polynomials at each x using cross-validation, and the other chooses the bandwidth at each x using C p . Finally, we comment on the efficacy of using asymptotics to provide guidance for methods of local regression.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose myocardial infarction ({MI}) detection using 12-lead {ECG} data and analysis of each lead with the help of composite lead. This composite lead is used to detect {ECG} wave components and clinical wave intervals in all the 12-lead {ECG}. The four clinical features such as P duration, {QRS} duration, {ST}-T complex interval and {QT} interval are globally determined from average beats of all the 12-lead {ECG}. Then peak to peak amplitude, area, mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis are determined for P duration, {QRS} duration and {ST}-T complex interval of average beats of all the 12-lead {ECG}. These 220 (4 + 6 × 3 × 12) parameters are used for myocardial infarction detection. The standard 12-lead {ECG} data of 60 myocardial infarction subjects and 60 healthy controls ({HC}) cases are obtained from Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt ({PTB}) database and tested with support vector machine ({SVM}) classifier. The {MI} detection sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are 96.66\%, 100\% and 98.33\% respectively. To reduce the computational complexity, feature dimension reduction is important. Therefore, proposed method applies Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) reduction technique. In this proposed method, 220 features are reduced to 14 features, using these 14 features, {MI} detection achieved by {SVM} classifier is: sensitivity 96.66\%, specificity 96.66\% and accuracy 96.66\%.},

Approach: We train an ensemble of fully convolutional neural networks on the {PTB} {ECG} dataset and apply state-of-the-art attribution methods. Main results: Our classifier reaches 93.3\% sensitivity and 89.7\% specificity evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation with sampling based on patients. The presented method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and reaches the performance level of human cardiologists for detection of myocardial infarction. We are able to discriminate channel-specific regions that contribute most significantly to the neural network’s decision. Interestingly, the network’s decision is influenced by signs also recognized by human cardiologists as indicative of myocardial infarction. Significance: Our results demonstrate the high prospects of algorithmic {ECG} analysis for future clinical applications considering both its quantitative performance as well as the possibility of assessing decision criteria on a per-example basis, which enhances the comprehensibility of the approach.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel algorithm based on a convolutional neural network ({CNN}) is proposed for myocardial infarction detection via multilead electrocardiogram ({ECG}). A beat segmentation algorithm utilizing multilead {ECG} is designed to obtain multilead beats, and fuzzy information granulation is adopted for preprocessing. Then, the beats are input into our multilead-{CNN} ({ML}-{CNN}), a novel model that includes sub two-dimensional (2-D) convolutional layers and lead asymmetric pooling ({LAP}) layers. As different leads represent various angles of the same heart, {LAP} can capture multiscale features of different leads, exploiting the individual characteristics of each lead. In addition, sub 2-D convolution can utilize the holistic characters of all the leads. It uses 1-D kernels shared among the different leads to generate local optimal features. These strategies make the {ML}-{CNN} suitable for multilead {ECG} processing. To evaluate our algorithm, actual {ECG} datasets from the {PTB} diagnostic database are used. The sensitivity of our algorithm is 95.40\%, the specificity is 97.37\%, and the accuracy is 96.00\% in the experiments. Targeting lightweight mobile healthcare applications, real-time analyses are performed on both {MATLAB} and {ARM} Cortex-A9 platforms. The average processing times for each heartbeat are approximately 17.10 and 26.75 ms, respectively, which indicate that this method has good potential for mobile healthcare applications.},

The upward bias may be negligible in leave-one-out cross-validation, but it sometimes cannot be neglected in 5-fold or 10-fold cross-validation, which are favored from a computational standpoint. Since the training error has a downward bias and K-fold cross-validation has an upward bias, there will be an appropriate estimate in a family that connects the two estimates.

It is the responsibility of the data analyst to formulate the scientific issue at hand in terms of {PC} projections, {PLS} regressions, etc. Ask yourself, or the investigator, why the data matrix was collected, and for what purpose the experiments and measurements were made. Specify before the analysis what kinds of patterns you would expect and what you would find exciting. The results of the analysis depend on the scaling of the matrix, which therefore must be specified. Variance scaling, where each variable is scaled to unit variance, can be recommended for general use, provided that almost constant variables are left unscaled. Combining different types of variables warrants blockscaling. In the initial analysis, look for outliers and strong groupings in the plots, indicating that the data matrix perhaps should be “polished” or whether disjoint modeling is the proper course. For plotting purposes, two or three principal components are usually sufficient, but for modeling purposes the number of significant components should be properly determined, e.g. by cross-validation. Use the resulting principal components to guide your continued investigation or chemical experimentation, not as an end in itself.},

	abstract = {The Fifth International Workshop-Conference on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ({GDM}) was held in Chicago, {IL}, 11–13 November 2005 under the sponsorship of the American Diabetes Association. The meeting provided a forum for review of new information concerning {GDM} in the areas of pathophysiology, epidemiology, perinatal outcome, long-range implications for mother and her offspring, and management strategies. New information and recommendations related to each of these major topics are summarized in the report that follows.

The issues regarding strategies and criteria for the detection and diagnosis of {GDM} were not reviewed or discussed in detail, since it is anticipated that the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome ({HAPO}) study will provide data in mid-2007 that will foster the development of criteria for the diagnosis of {GDM} that are based on perinatal outcomes. Thus, for the interim, the participants of the Fifth International Workshop-Conference on {GDM} endorsed a motion to continue use of the definition, classification criteria, and strategies for detection and diagnosis of {GDM} that were recommended at the Fourth Workshop-Conference. Those guidelines are reproduced (with minor modifications) in this article in appendix Tables 1 and 2.

The invited lectures, topical discussions, and posters presented at the conference and the invited manuscripts that appear in this issue of Diabetes Care served as the basis for the following summary and recommendations.

\#\#\# Pathophysiology

\#\#\#\# General considerations.

Current diagnostic criteria assign the diagnosis of {GDM} to women with glucose levels in the upper ∼5–10\% of the population distribution. The hyperglycemia varies in severity from glucose concentrations that would be diagnostic of diabetes outside of pregnancy to concentrations that are asymptomatic and only slightly above normal, but associated with some increased risk of fetal morbidity.

Like all forms of hyperglycemia, {GDM} is characterized by insulin levels that are insufficient to meet insulin demands. The causes of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction that …},

The sensitivity of the 14–16 week {OGTT} to identify women who would develop {GDM} or have {LGA} babies was low, and we could not identify alternative cut-offs to exclude women not at risk or identify women that could benefit from early intervention. First trimester β-cell function was a stronger determinant than third trimester β-cell function of predicting maternal pre-diabetes. In conclusion, in our normal low-risk population, the 75 g {OGTT} at 14–16 weeks is insufficient to identify candidates for early treatment of {GDM} or identify women not likely to develop {GDM} or have {LGA} babies.

	abstract = {The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups ({IADPSG}) was formed in 1998 as an umbrella organization to facilitate collaboration between the various regional and national groups that have a primary or significant focus on diabetes and pregnancy. The principal objectives of {IADPSG} are to foster an international approach to enhancing the quality of care, facilitating research, and advancing education in the field of diabetes in pregnancy.

During 11–12 June 2008, the {IADPSG} sponsored an International Workshop- Conference on Gestational Diabetes Diagnosis and Classification in Pasadena, California. More than 225 conferees from 40 countries reviewed published results of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome ({HAPO}) study, additional unpublished {HAPO} study findings, and results of other work that examined associations of maternal glycemia with perinatal and long-term outcomes in offspring. Conferees then held regional caucuses to consider clinical implications of the information that had been presented. On 13 June 2008, the {IADPSG} Consensus Panel (with representation from the 10 member organizations of the {IADPSG} and other organizations with an interest in diabetes and pregnancy) was convened. Members of the {IADPSG} Consensus Panel are listed in the online-only appendix, available at http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc09-1848/{DC}1. Subsequently, the {IADPSG} Consensus Panel reviewed further {HAPO} study results. Through this process, the consensus summarized in this report was reached.

Maternal obesity, excess maternal weight gain during pregnancy, and gestational diabetes are all associated with large for gestational age infants and other adverse outcomes. With obesity being a major risk factor for gestational diabetes (diabetes first recognised in pregnancy), the increasing incidence of the condition is unsurprising. Treatment of obesity during pregnancy has disappointingly little effect on the numbers of babies born large for gestational age, but treatment of gestational diabetes is more successful. This has led to an emphasis on diagnosing and treating gestational diabetes, but do the recently proposed diagnostic criteria1 that triple its prevalence make sense?

Aim and Objective: This study is mainly concerned with the pattern of tubal and peritoneal abnormalities and their effects on fertility outcome. Materials and Methods: A prospective study of 220 consecutive patients who underwent {HSG} between December, 2011 and May, 2013, at Department of Radiology, Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Zaria. Clinical notes and radiological findings were analyzed for demographic data, tubal and peritoneal pathologies. Fertility outcome in patients with abnormal findings was compared with those with normal findings. Results: A total of 121 (55.0\%) patients had normal tubes on {HSG}. Tube abnormalities were found in 99 (45.0\%) patients; 37 (37\%) patients with primary and 62 (63\%) patients with secondary infertility.

To understand the role of Chlamydia trachomatis serology in tubal patency testing. To evaluate the role of tubal patency test in the hierarchy of investigations for infertility. To understand the role of tubal surgery in modern management of infertility. To understand the importance of medical history taking in infertility.

	abstract = {Background: Infertility is a major clinico-social issue in Nigeria. Hysterosalpingography ({HSG})
is commonly used in the investigation of causes of female infertility.
Objective:To evaluate the {HSG} technique and radiographic findings among infertile women examined in a tertiary health institution in Benin, Nigeria.
Subjects and Methods: The study was a prospective survey. Both ethical approval and consents of
women recruited for the study were obtained before the study commenced. A convenience sample of 238 women was recruited for the study.
Data collection: Literature was reviewed to determine if {HSG} was performed in accordance with current imaging best practices in the center studied. Furthermore, radiologist’s reports of all {HSG} examinations performed in the center within the study period were reviewed to determine {HSG} detected common causes of female infertility in Benin, Nigeria.
Data analysis: Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data. Statistical analysis was performed with the {SPSS} computer software, version 17.0. Results were presented in tables and bar charts.Results revealed that investigation of causes of female infertility were still being performed using the traditional fluoroscopic {HSG} technique with static x-ray machine in the center during the period studied. Whereas 37.0\% of women referred for {HSG} were in the 34-39 years age range, 70.0\% percent of them were investigated for secondary infertility. Twenty-five (25.0\%) percent of women studied had normal {HSG} examinations,27.0\% had tubal occlusion while 17\% had uterine fibroids.
Conclusions: In spite of {HSG} technique in the center studied not being performed in accordance with current imaging best practices, the modality still plays a significant role in the investigation of female infertility. Furthermore, tubal occlusion and leiomyoma were the most common {HSG} detected uterine lesions among the population of infertile women studied.},

Objective: To review abnormal tubal pathological findings in hysterosalphingography ({HSG}) among women being investigated for primary and secondary infertility in Sokoto. Method: This is a retrospective review of {HSG} results of 317 women being investigated for both primary and secondary infertility was reviewed. The study was conducted from July 2009 to August 2012. Results: A total of 317 patients were studied. The age ranges of the study participants was from 17 - 48 years with a mean and standard deviation value of 32.5 ± 5.5. Out of the sample size, 139 (43.85\%) showed normal {HSG} findings while 178 (56.15\%) patients had abnormal {HSG} findings. Tubal abnormalities were found in 112 (35.33\%) of the patients. The commonest tubal abnormality was tubal blockage.Conclusion: The high incidence of tubal pathology revealed in this study showed that {HSG} is still a very vital tool for infertility work-up. Early detection and prompt treatment of infection in our women should be encouraged as it is the major leading cause of tubal pathologies and consequently this would reduce the contribution of tubal infertility in this environment.{DOI}: http://dx.doi.org/10.3126/ajms.v6i2.10581Asian Journal of Medical Sciences Vol.6(2) 2015 48-51},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To compare diagnostic accuracy of {MR}-hysterosalpingography ({MR}-{HSG}) and conventional hysterosalpingography (X-{HSG}) in the evaluation of female infertility.
{METHODS}: Forty women received prospectively both X-{HSG}, the gold standard technique, and {MR}-{HSG} on the same day but the order in which they were conducted was randomised. A 1.5 Tesla {MRI} was performed with classical sequences for pelvic analysis and an additional 3D T1-weighted sequence with intra-uterine injection of gadolinium. Two radiologists independently interpreted X-{HSG} and {MR}-{HSG} according to randomisation, blinded to the other results. They both then performed a second interpretation of {MR}-{HSG} blinded to the first reading with a minimum time delay of 1 week. Diagnostic performance of {MR}-{HSG} for analysis of tubal and intracavity abnormalities was evaluated by calculating sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value ({PPV}) and negative predictive value ({NPV}).
{RESULTS}: Twenty-six patients were included. Diagnostic performance of {MR}-{HSG} was: Se: 91.7\% (95\% {CI} 61.5-99.8); Sp: 92.9\% (95\% {CI} 66.1-99.8) ; {PPV}: 91.7\% (95\% {CI} 61.5-99.8); {NPV}: 92.9\% (95\% {CI} 66.1-99.8). Pain analysis showed a significant statistical difference between the two procedures: average {VAS} for X-{HSG} was 4.43 (95\% {CI} 3.50-5.36) versus 3.46 (95\% {CI} 2.62-4.31) for {MR}-{HSG}, p=0,01. Intra- and inter-rater agreements for detection of tubal or intracavity abnormalities were 0.92 (95\% {CI} 0.78-1.00) and 0.76 (95\% {CI} 0.52-1.00).
{CONCLUSION}: {MR}-{HSG} is a well-tolerated technique demonstrating high accuracy in investigating tubal patency and intra-uterine abnormalities for diagnostic work-up of female infertility.
{KEY} {POINTS}: • {MR}-hysterosalpingography is an innovative technique. • Hysterosalpingography can be used to investigate tubal patency and intracavity abnormalities. • Hysterosalpingography is a potential 'one-stop-shop' imaging technique for a single comprehensive examination of female infertility.},

The purpose of the study was to assess the various uterine and tubal abnormalities leading to infertility Objective To assess the abnormalities in uterus and fallopian tubes detected on Hysterosalpingography (as causative factors of infertility in a tertiary care centre for proper decision making in treatment. Method This is the prospective cross sectional study done in department of radiology Dhulikhel hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital between January 2015 to January 2016 with complain of infertility. Hysterosalpingography was performed using ionic contrast medium (10-20 ml of 76\% urograffin) under digital fluoroscopy. Radiographic films were obtained and analyzed. Demographic data and radiological findings were reviewed and the obtained data analyzed with {SPSS} version 16. Result Out of the total 100 patient, 75 had primary infertility while 25 had secondary infertility. The age ranged from 19 to 43 years with mean age of 27.75 years. Normal Hysterosalpingography findings were seen in 37\% cases. Tubal abnormalities were seen in 34\%, uterine abnormalities in 23\% and both tubal and uterine abnormalities in 6\% patients. The most common tubal abnormality detected on Hysterosalpingography was tubal block 75\%. Out of the 30 patients who had tubal block, unilateral block was noted in 76.7\% patients whereas bilateral block was noted in 23.3\%. Hydrosalphinx was seen in 25\% cases with tubal abnormality.

Mean age of presentation for primary infertility was 30 years and 35 years for secondary infertility. Bilateral free peritoneal spill was noted in 60\% of cases. Unilateral tubal blockage was present in 15\% and bilateral tubal blockage in 10\% of patients. Bilateral hydrosalpinx was present in 10\% of patients and unilateral loculated spill was found in 5\% of patients with primary infertility. Patients with uterine congenital anomalies were also evaluated and the frequency of bicornuate uterus was 4\%, unicornuate uterus was 2\% and uterine didelphys was 0.2\%.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Infertile patients who underwent {HSG} were mostly in older age group with secondary infertility being slightly more common emphasizing early work up and care. Most of the patients with primary infertility had normal {HSG} examination. To our knowledge this is the largest data for {HSG} to be presented from Pakistan.},

	abstract = {Tubal disease constitutes a major factor in infertility especially in developing countries. This study was
undertaken to assess the hysterosalpingographic patterns seen in infertile patients in an urban centre
in Lagos. Two hundred and twenty patients who reported from the gynaecology clinic to the radiology
department of Lagos State University Teaching Hospital were subjected to hysterosalpingography, and
the results were analyzed for tubal pathology as revealed on radiographs. One hundred and eighty five
(84\%) patients had secondary infertility while 35(16\%) had primary infertility. The commonest pathology
found on hysterosalpingography in patients presenting with infertility in this study was tubal blockage,
whether unilateral or bilateral, followed by hydrosalpinx of one or both fallopian tubes. Eighty four
(38.2\%) patients had both fallopian tubes opacified and were classified as normal, while in 22(10\%),
both tubes were not seen. Of the opacified abnormal fallopian tubes, bilateral hydrosalpinx was
diagnosed in 6 patients (2.7\%), while right and left sided hydrosalpinx were seen in 6(2.7\%) and 8(3.6\%)
patients respectively. There was evidence of loculated peritoneal contrast spills from 10(4.5\%) on each
of the sides and from both tubes in 2(1\%) patients. The high prevalence of tubal pathology was
demonstrated in this study but the contribution of hydrosalpinx is much less than findings from other
centres in the sub region.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: There are limited number of studies with controversial findings regarding the association between anemia at admission and coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) outcomes. Therefore, in this research, we aimed to investigate the prospective association between anemia and {COVID}-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients in Iran.
{METHODS}: In this prospective study, the data of 1274 consecutive patients hospitalized due to {COVID}-19 were statistically analyzed. All biomarkers, including hemoglobin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-{CRP}) levels were measured using standard methods. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of less than 13 g/{dL} and 12 g/{dL} in males and females, respectively. Assessing the association between anemia and {COVID}-19 survival in hospitalized patients was our primary endpoint.
{RESULTS}: The mean age of the participants was 64.43 ± 17.16 years, out of whom 615 (48.27\%) were anemic subjects. Patients with anemia were significantly older (P = 0.02) and had a higher frequency of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, kidney disease, diabetes, and cancer (P {\textless} 0.05). The frequency of death (anemic: 23.9\% vs. nonanemic: 13.8\%), {ICU} admission (anemic: 27.8\% vs. nonanemic:14.71\%), and ventilator requirement (anemic: 35.93\% vs. nonanemic: 20.63\%) were significantly higher in anemic patients than in nonanemic patients (P {\textless} 0.001). According to the results of regression analysis, after adjusting for significant covariate in the univariable model, anemia was independently associated with mortality ({OR}: 1.68, 95\% {CI}: 1.10, 2.57, P = 0.01), ventilator requirement ({OR}: 1.74, 95\% {CI}: 1.19, 2.54, P = 0.004), and the risk of {ICU} admission ({OR}: 2.06, 95\% {CI}: 1.46, 2.90, P {\textless} 0.001).
{CONCLUSION}: The prevalence of anemia in hospitalized patients with {COVID}-19 was high and was associated with poor outcomes of {COVID}-19.},

	abstract = {{COVID}-19 patients typically present with lower airway disease, although involvement of other organ systems is usually the rule. Hematological manifestations such as thrombocytopenia and reduced lymphocyte and eosinophil numbers are highly prevalent in {COVID}-19 and have prognostic significance. Few data, however, are available about the prevalence and significance of anemia in {COVID}-19. In an observational study, we investigated the prevalence, pathogenesis and clinical significance of anemia among 206 patients with {COVID}-19 at the time of their hospitalization in an Internal Medicine unit. The prevalence of anemia was 61\% in {COVID}-19, compared with 45\% in a control group of 71 patients with clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of {COVID}-19, but nasopharyngeal swab tests negative for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RNA} (p = 0.022). Mortality was higher in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 positive patients. In {COVID}-19, females had lower hemoglobin concentration than males and a higher prevalence of moderate/severe anemia (25\% versus 13\%, p = 0.032). In most cases, anemia was mild and due to inflammation, sometimes associated with iron and/or vitamin deficiencies. Determinants of hemoglobin concentration included: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum cholinesterase, ferritin and protein concentrations and number of chronic diseases affecting each patient. Hemoglobin concentration was not related to overall survival that was, on the contrary, influenced by red blood cell distribution width, age, lactate dehydrogenase and the ratio of arterial partial oxygen pressure to inspired oxygen fraction. In conclusion, our results highlight anemia as a common manifestation in {COVID}-19. Although anemia does not directly influence mortality, it usually affects elderly, frail patients and can negatively influence their quality of life.},

	abstract = {The recently emerged {SARS}-{CoV}-2 causing the ongoing {COVID}-19 pandemic is particularly virulent in the elderly while children are largely spared. Here, we explored the potential role of cross-reactive immunity acquired from pediatric vaccinations and exposure to common human pathogens in the protection and pathology of {COVID}-19. To that end, we sought for peptide matches to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 (identity ≥ 80\%, in at least eight residues) in the proteomes of 25 human pathogens and in vaccine antigens, and subsequently predicted their T and B cell reactivity to identify potential cross-reactive epitopes. We found that viruses subject to pediatric vaccinations do not contain cross-reactive epitopes with {SARS}-{CoV}-2, precluding that they can provide any general protection against {COVID}-19. Likewise, common viruses including rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and several herpesviruses are also poor or null sources of cross-reactive immunity to {SARS}-{CoV}-2, discarding that immunological memory against these viruses can have any general protective or pathological role in {COVID}-19. In contrast, we found combination vaccines for treating diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis infectious diseases ({DTP} vaccine) to be significant sources of potential cross-reactive immunity to {SARS}-{CoV}-2. {DTP} cross-reactive epitopes with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 include numerous {CD}8 and {CD}4 T cell epitopes with broad population protection coverage and potentially neutralizing B cell epitopes in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 Spike protein. Worldwide, children receive several {DTP} vaccinations, including three-four doses the first year of life and one at 4-6 years of age. Moreover, a low antigenic Tdap dose is also given at ages 9-14. Thereby, children may well be protected from {SARS}-{CoV}-2 through cross-reactive immunity elicited by {DTP} vaccinations, supporting testing in the general population to prevent {COVID}-19.},

	abstract = {Background: T cells control viral infection, promote vaccine durability, and in coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) associate with mild disease. We investigated whether prior measles-mumps-rubella ({MMR}) or tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap) vaccination elicits cross-reactive T cells that mitigate {COVID}-19.
Methods: Antigen-presenting cells ({APC}) loaded ex vivo with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2), {MMR}, or Tdap antigens and autologous T cells from {COVID}-19-convalescent participants, uninfected individuals, and {COVID}-19 {mRNA}-vaccinated donors were co-cultured. T cell activation and phenotype were detected by interferon-γ ({IFN}-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot ({ELISpot}) assays and flow cytometry. {ELISAs} (enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays) and validation studies identified the {APC}-derived cytokine(s) driving T cell activation. {TCR} clonotyping and single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) identified cross-reactive T cells and their transcriptional profile. A propensity-weighted analysis of {COVID}-19 patients estimated the effects of {MMR} and Tdap vaccination on {COVID}-19 outcomes.
Findings: High correlation was observed between T cell responses to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 (spike-S1 and nucleocapsid) and {MMR} and Tdap proteins in {COVID}-19-convalescent and -vaccinated individuals. The overlapping T cell population contained an effector memory T cell subset (effector memory re-expressing {CD}45RA on T cells [{TEMRA}]) implicated in protective, anti-viral immunity, and their detection required {APC}-derived {IL}-15, known to sensitize T cells to activation. Cross-reactive {TCR} repertoires detected in antigen-experienced T cells recognizing {SARS}-{CoV}-2, {MMR}, and Tdap epitopes had {TEMRA} features. Indices of disease severity were reduced in {MMR}- or Tdap-vaccinated individuals by 32\%-38\% and 20\%-23\%, respectively, among {COVID}-19 patients.
Conclusions: Tdap and {MMR} memory T cells reactivated by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 may provide protection against severe {COVID}-19.

	abstract = {{BackgroundCOVID}-19 is characterized by strikingly large, mostly unexplained, interindividual variation in symptom severity: while some individuals remain nearly asymptomatic, others suffer from severe respiratory failure. Previous vaccinations for other pathogens, in particular tetanus, may partly explain this variation, possibly by readying the immune system.{MethodsWe} made use of data on {COVID}-19 testing from 103,049 participants of the {UK} Biobank (mean age 71.5 years, 54.2\% female), coupled to immunization records of the last ten years. Using logistic regression, covarying for age, sex, respiratory disease diagnosis, and socioeconomic status, we tested whether individuals vaccinated for tetanus, diphtheria or pertussis, differed from individuals that had only received other vaccinations on 1) undergoing a {COVID}-19 test, 2) being diagnosed with {COVID}-19, and 3) whether they developed severe {COVID}-19 symptoms.{ResultsWe} found that individuals with registered diphtheria or tetanus vaccinations are less likely to develop severe {COVID}-19 than people who had only received other vaccinations (diphtheria odds ratio ({OR})=0.47, p-value=5.3*10-5; tetanus {OR}=0.52, p-value=1.2*10-4).{DiscussionThese} results indicate that a history of diphtheria or tetanus vaccinations is associated with less severe manifestations of {COVID}-19. These vaccinations may protect against severe {COVID}-19 symptoms by stimulating the immune system.

	abstract = {The standard median filter based on a symmetric moving window has only one tuning parameter: the window width. Despite this limitation, this filter has proven extremely useful and has motivated a number of extensions: weighted median filters, recursive median filters, and various cascade structures. The Hampel filter is a member of the class of decsion filters that replaces the central value in the data window with the median if it lies far enough from the median to be deemed an outlier. This filter depends on both the window width and an additional tuning parameter t, reducing to the median filter when t=0, so it may be regarded as another median filter extension. This paper adopts this view, defining and exploring the class of generalized Hampel filters obtained by applying the median filter extensions listed above: weighted Hampel filters, recursive Hampel filters, and their cascades. An important concept introduced here is that of an implosion sequence, a signal for which generalized Hampel filter performance is independent of the threshold parameter t. These sequences are important because the added flexibility of the generalized Hampel filters offers no practical advantage for implosion sequences. Partial characterization results are presented for these sequences, as are useful relationships between root sequences for generalized Hampel filters and their median-based counterparts. To illustrate the performance of this filter class, two examples are considered: one is simulation-based, providing a basis for quantitative evaluation of signal recovery performance as a function of t, while the other is a sequence of monthly Italian industrial production index values that exhibits glaring outliers.},

	abstract = {Summary. We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called {LARS}-{EN} is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm {LARS} does for the lasso.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, a significant number of infectious diseases such as human coronavirus disease ({COVID}-19) are threatening the world by spreading at an alarming rate. Some of the literatures pointed out that the pandemic is exhibiting seasonal patterns in its spread, incidence and nature of the distribution. In connection to the spread and distribution of the infection, scientific analysis that answers the questions whether the next summer can save people from {COVID}-19 is required. Many researchers have been exclusively asked whether high temperature during summer can slow down the spread of the {COVID}-19 as it has with other seasonal flues. Since there are a lot of questions that are unanswered right now, and many mysteries aspects about the {COVID}-19 that is still unknown to us, in-depth study and analysis of associated weather features are required. Moreover, understanding the nature of {COVID}-19 and forecasting the spread of {COVID}-19 request more investigation of the real effect of weather variables on the transmission of the {COVID}-19 among people. In this work, various regressor machine learning models are proposed to extract the relationship between different factors and the spreading rate of {COVID}-19. The machine learning algorithms employed in this work estimate the impact of weather variables such as temperature and humidity on the transmission of {COVID}-19 by extracting the relationship between the number of confirmed cases and the weather variables on certain regions. To validate the proposed method, we have collected the required datasets related to weather and census features and necessary prepossessing is carried out. From the experimental results, it is shown that the weather variables are more relevant in predicting the mortality rate when compared to the other census variables such as population, age, and urbanization. Thus, from this result, we can conclude that temperature and humidity are important features for predicting {COVID}-19 mortality rate. Moreover, it is indicated that the higher the value of temperature the lower number of infection cases.},

	abstract = {Background Since the first cases of {COVID}-19 were reported in Wuhan, the nutritional status of individuals infected with the virus has not been included in the risk profiles prepared. However, nutritional status, along with other factors, is decisive in the evolution of patients with other infectious diseases. The nutritional status of individuals is considered an indicator of health status. Furthermore, optimal nutritional status transcends the individual, and poor diet in a population can be considered a group risk factor. Evidence exists on the influence that diet has on the immune system and susceptibility to disease.Objective To evaluate the nutritional status of patients older than 65 years who were admitted due to {COVID}-19 and how this has influenced the evolution of patients.Design This prospective and observational study was performed in patients with {COVID}-19 infection confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Data were collected from the first 24 h of admission. All patients admitted during one month to the wards assigned to {COVID}-19 infection were included.Results A total of 83 patients were studied. The statistical study of mortality showed associations with age (p = .005), living in a nursing home (p = .022), a high Charlson Comorbidity Index (p = .039), hypertension (p = .032), comorbidities of dementia (p = .019) and cerebral vascular disease (p = .041), and Barthel Index (p = .010). The analysis of the influence of the nutritional state on mortality revealed a statistical association between malnutrition and mortality in the pooled data analysis (p = .005) and analysis by degrees of malnutrition (p = .27).Conclusions Malnutrition was a risk factor as powerful as others such as hypertension, age, and different comorbidities. We must evaluate and treat the nutritional status of elderly patients with {COVID}-19 infection since it directly affects their evolution.},

Regression analysis was conducted to screen for risk factors for malnutrition. A total of 182 patients were included in the study, of which 27.5\% were in the group with malnutrition risk and 52.7\% were in the malnutrition group. There were statistical differences in the incidence of comorbid diabetes mellitus, body mass index ({BMI}), calf circumference,albumin, hemoglobin, and lymphocyte counts among the three groups. Further regression analysis suggested that combined diabetes, low calf circumference, and low albumin were independent risk factors for malnutrition. The prevalence of malnutrition in elderly patients with {COVID}-19 was high, and nutritional support should be strengthened during treatment, especially for those with diabetes mellitus, low calf circumference, or low albumin.},

	abstract = {The {COVID}-19 pandemic has evolved into arguably the largest global public health crisis in recent history – especially in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or an effective anti-viral treatment. As reported, the virus seems to less commonly infect children and causing less severe symptoms among infected children. Hypotheses about cross-immunogenicity of existing childhood vaccines with the novel coronavirus have been offered. This narrative review provides an inclusive view of scientific hypotheses, logical derivation, and early analyses that substantiate or refute such conjectures. At the completion of a relatively less restrictive search of this evolving topic, thirteen articles – all published in 2020, were included in this early narrative review. Directional themes arising from the identified literature suggest the potential relationship between childhood vaccination and {COVID}-19 – either based on the potential genomic and immunological protective effects of heterologous immunity, or based on observational associations of cross-immunity among vaccines and other prior endemic diseases. Our review suggests that immune response to the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus in children is different than in adults, resulting in differences in the levels of severity of symptoms and outcomes of the disease in different age groups. Further clinical investigations are warranted of at least three childhood vaccines: {BCG}, {MMR} and {HEP}-A for their potential protective role against the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus.},

Significance Statement The {COVID}-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating in recent history. The bacillus Calmette-Guérin ({BCG}) vaccine against tuberculosis also confers broad protection against other infectious diseases, and it has been proposed that it could reduce the severity of {COVID}-19. This epidemiological study assessed the global linkage between {BCG} vaccination and {COVID}-19 mortality. Signals of {BCG} vaccination effect on {COVID}-19 mortality are influenced by social, economic, and demographic differences between countries. After mitigating multiple confounding factors, several significant associations between {BCG} vaccination and reduced {COVID}-19 deaths were observed. This study highlights the need for mechanistic studies behind the effect of {BCG} vaccination on {COVID}-19, and for clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of {BCG} vaccination to protect from severe {COVID}-19.},

	abstract = {While mortality attributable to {COVID}-19 has devastated global health systems and economies, striking regional differences have been observed. The Bacille Calmette Guérin ({BCG}) vaccine has previously been shown to have non-specific protective effects on infections, as well as long-term efficacy against tuberculosis. Using publicly available data we built a simple log-linear regression model to assess the association of {BCG} use and {COVID}-19-attributable mortality per 1 million population after adjusting for confounders including country economic status ({GDP} per capita), and proportion of elderly among the population. The timing of country entry into the pandemic epidemiological trajectory was aligned by plotting time since the 100th reported case. Countries with economies classified as lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income and high-income countries ({LMIC}, {UMIC}, {HIC}) had median crude {COVID}-19 log-mortality of 0.4 (Interquartile Range ({IQR}) 0.1, 0.4), 0.7 ({IQR} 0.2, 2.2) and 5.5 ({IQR} 1.6, 13.9), respectively. {COVID}-19-attributable mortality among {BCG}-using countries was 5.8 times lower [95\% {CI} 1.8-19.0] than in non {BCG}-using countries. Notwithstanding limitations due to testing constraints in {LMICs}, case ascertainment bias and a plausible rise of cases as countries progress along the epidemiological trajectory, these analyses provide intriguing observations that urgently warrant mobilization of resources for prospective randomized interventional studies and institution of systematic disease surveillance, particularly in {LMICs}.},

	abstract = {{COVID}-19 has spread to most countries in the world. Puzzlingly, the impact of the disease varies in different countries. This variation is attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. Here, we propose that national differences in {COVID}-19 impact could be partially explained by different national policies with respect to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ({BCG}) vaccination. {BCG} vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection from other respiratory infections besides tuberculosis. We compared {BCG} vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for {COVID}-19 for middle-high and high-income countries. We found that countries without universal policies of {BCG} vaccination (Italy, the Netherlands, {USA}) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing {BCG} policies. The difference cannot be accounted for by differences in disease onset, adoption of early social distancing policies, state of health services, nor income level. Reduced mortality suggests {BCG} vaccination could be a potential new tool in the fight against {COVID}-19.},

	abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) pandemic has become a worldwide emergency. In the attempt to search for interventions that would improve outcomes, some researchers have looked at the potential benefit of {BCG} vaccination. These early studies have found a statistically significant reduction in {COVID}-19 related mortality in countries with a current universal bacille Calmette-Guérin ({BCG}) vaccination policy; partially explained by induced heterologous immunity. However, just as the authors themselves noted, the nature of ecological studies make them very prone to the presence of several confounders. This paper tries to answer the question as to whether a statistically significant difference in mortality rates exists between countries with differing {BCG} vaccination policies; while being the first to try to account for most of these confounders. We compared the number of {COVID}-19 related deaths per 1 million inhabitants as well as the number of deaths at the time the countries hit the 1000th {COVID}-19 case. Countries were divided in those which never had a {BCG} vaccination policy, those with a prior vaccination policy and those with a current vaccination policy. All data was gathered from publicly available sources. It was found that no statistically significant difference exists in mortality rates between countries with differing {BCG} vaccination policies. This result seems to reflect the notion that heterologous immunity fades with time after administration. Nevertheless, the immunostimulatory potential of the {BCG} vaccine might still prove useful in the development of future vaccines or other prophylactic measures.},

	abstract = {In December 2019 a new coronavirus {COVID}-19 was identified in China then spread all over the world. {WHO} defined China and Italy as the epicenters for {COVID}-19. Insufficient vaccine coverage has been identified as a key causative factor in the most epidemic outbreaks. Vaccines generally raise specific immune responses to a targeted pathogen, but measles vaccines have recently proved the increased ability of the immune system to fight off pathogens other than measles. {COVID}-19 is proven to have similarities with measles. Such similarities may cause cross-reactivity between measles vaccines and {COVID}-19. For instance, comparing China and Italy for {COVID}-19 case and the death rates from late 2019 until Mars 25, 2020, Italy showed higher ratio of {COVID}-19 cases/population and a higher death rate than China. In contrast, Italy showed lower measles vaccination coverage than China. In this review, we hypothesized that the bystander immunity induced by measles vaccines may provide partial protection against {COVID}-19, decreasing the virus’s ability to cause fatal symptoms and controlling the infection leading to full recovery. Accordingly, we suggest multi-center clinical trials to evaluate the possibility of induced partial protection by measles-containing vaccines against {COVID}-19.},

	abstract = {The {COVID}-19 disease is one of worst pandemics to sweep the globe in recent times. It is noteworthy that the disease has its greatest impact on the elderly. Herein, we investigated the potential of childhood vaccination, specifically against measles, mumps and rubella ({MMR}), to identify if this could potentially confer acquired protection over {SARS}-{CoV}-2. We identified sequence homology between the fusion proteins of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and measles and mumps viruses. Moreover, we also identified a 29\% amino acid sequence homology between the Macro ({ADP}-ribose-1’’-phosphatase) domains of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and rubella virus. The rubella Macro domain has surface-exposed conserved residues and is present in the attenuated rubella virus in {MMR}. Hence, we hypothesize that {MMR} could protect against poor outcome in {COVID}-19 infection. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we identified that 1) age groups that most likely lack of {MMR} vaccine-induced immunity had the poorest outcome in {COVID}-19, and 2) {COVID}-19 disease burden correlates with rubella antibody titres, potentially induced by {SARS}-{CoV}2 homologous sequences. We therefore propose that vaccination of ‘at risk’ age groups with an {MMR} vaccination merits further consideration as a time appropriate and safe intervention.},

There is mounting evidence that live attenuated vaccines provide nonspecific protection against lethal infections unrelated to the target pathogen of the vaccine by inducing "trained" nonspecific innate immune cells for improved host responses against subsequent infections. Mortality in {COVID}-19 cases is strongly associated with progressive lung inflammation and eventual sepsis. Vaccination with {MMR} in immunocompetent individuals has no contraindications and may be especially effective for health care workers who can easily be exposed to {COVID}-19. Following the lead of other countries conducting clinical trials with the live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis {BCG} ({BCG}) vaccine under a similar concept, a clinical trial with {MMR} in high-risk populations may provide a "low-risk-high-reward" preventive measure in saving lives during this unprecedented {COVID}-19 pandemic.},

Nonetheless, recombinant {BCG} strains expressing antigens of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 may offer protection against {COVID}-19 due to the activation of innate as well as specific adaptive immune response. Further proven safety records of {BCG} in humans, its adjuvant activity and low cost manufacturing makes it a frontrunner in the vaccine development to stop this pandemic.

Safe and effective anti-{SARS}-{CoV}-2 vaccines are urgently needed. However, emerging immunological observations show hallmarks of significant immunopathological characteristics and dysfunctional immune responses in patients with {COVID}-19. Combined with existing knowledge about immune responses to other closely related and highly pathogenic coronaviruses, this could forebode significant challenges for vaccine development, including the risk of vaccine failure. Animal data from earlier coronavirus vaccine efforts indicate that elderly people, most at risk from severe {COVID}-19 disease, could be especially at risk from immunopathologic responses to novel coronavirus vaccines. Bacterial "new old friends" such as Bacille Calmette-Guérin ({BCG}) or Mycobacterium obuense have the ability to elevate basal systemic levels of type 1 cytokines and immune cells, correlating with increased protection against diverse and unrelated infectious agents, called "trained immunity." Here we describe dysfunctional immune responses induced by coronaviruses, representing potentially difficult to overcome obstacles to safe, effective vaccine development for {COVID}-19, and outline how trained immunity could help protect high risk populations through immunomodulation with {BCG} and other "new old friends."},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) is expected to continue to cause worldwide fatalities until the World population develops 'herd immunity', or until a vaccine is developed and used as a prevention. Meanwhile, there is an urgent need to identify alternative means of antiviral defense. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ({BCG}) vaccine that has been recognized for its off-target beneficial effects on the immune system can be exploited to boast immunity and protect from emerging novel viruses.
{METHODS}: We developed and employed a systems biology workflow capable of identifying small-molecule antiviral drugs and vaccines that can boast immunity and affect a wide variety of viral disease pathways to protect from the fatal consequences of emerging viruses.
{RESULTS}: Our analysis demonstrates that {BCG} vaccine affects the production and maturation of naïve T cells resulting in enhanced, long-lasting trained innate immune responses that can provide protection against novel viruses. We have identified small-molecule {BCG} mimics, including antiviral drugs such as raltegravir and lopinavir as high confidence hits. Strikingly, our top hits emetine and lopinavir were independently validated by recent experimental findings that these compounds inhibit the growth of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in vitro.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our results provide systems biology support for using {BCG} and small-molecule {BCG} mimics as putative vaccine and drug candidates against emergent viruses including {SARS}-{CoV}-2.},

The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ({BCG}) vaccination program is the principal element of tuberculosis control in Japan. We investigated the impact of routine infant {BCG} vaccination on prevention of local {COVID}-19 spread.
{METHODS}: Data on the prevalence of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection, annual routine infant {BCG} vaccine coverage (represented by the number of {BCG} vaccinations per live births), and other candidate factors in each prefecture were obtained from the official notifications database in Japan. We analysed the association of vaccine coverage with the prevalence of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection.
{RESULTS}: The {BCG} vaccine coverage in 1999-2002, 2004, and 2012 in five prefectures with no {COVID}-19 infections was significantly higher than that in five prefectures with a high prevalence of infections (Mann-Whitney U test, p{\textless}0.05). The prevalence of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection was significantly negatively correlated with {BCG} vaccine coverage in 2004 and was significantly positively correlated with age groups 20-34 and 40-54 years (Spearman's rank correlation, p{\textless}0.01).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings suggest that routine infant {BCG} vaccination coverage in young generation had a significant impact on prevention of local {COVID}-19 spread in Japan.},

{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS}: A review of the latest literature till 9 May 2020 has been made. {PubMed} and {ResearchGate} databases and {WHO} reports were used.
{RESULTS}: Immunomodulatory properties of the tuberculosis vaccine which protects against severe cases of tuberculosis and partly against other infections are indicated, including viral and respiratory infections. The {BCG} vaccine induces heterologous immunity and trained innate immunity. It was noted that in countries which maintain obligatory {BCG} vaccination {COVID}-19 incidence and mortality are lower than in countries that have stopped or never introduced {BCG} as mandatory vaccination. Most analysis confirmed this relationship, but they indicated the possible impact of other factors, such as genetics in the population, the type of strain from {BCG} vaccine, the level of health care and the wealth of a nation, the structure of migration, co-morbidities and a policy of introducing social distance.
{CONCLUSIONS}: At the moment, we do not have enough evidence to support or deny the hypothesis of {COVID}-19 reduction in incidence and mortality in countries maintaining obligatory {BCG} vaccination. Other factors that might affect the results should be considered in further analysis. The results of clinical trials will provide more reliable proofs than analysis of epidemiological data. {WHO} does not recommend {BCG} vaccination to prevent {COVID}-19 and recommends it to newborns from areas with a higher incidence of tuberculosis.},

	abstract = {{SARS}-{CoV}-2 had already killed more than 400,000 patients around the world according to data on 7 June 2020. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ({BCG}) vaccine is developed from live-attenuated Mycobacterium bovis, which is a microorganism found in a cow. Discovered by Dr. Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin since 1921, the {BCG} has served as a protection against tuberculosis and its complications. It is noticeable that countries which use mandatory {BCG} vaccination approach had lower {COVID}-19 infection and death rate. Current review aims to clarify this issue through epidemiological illustration of correlation between national {BCG} immunization and {COVID}-19 mortality, in addition to biological background of {BCG}-induced immunity Epidemiological data shows that universal {BCG} policy countries have lower median mortality rate compare to countries with past universal {BCG} policy and non-mass immunization {BCG}. (18 May 2020). Still, the links between {BCG} vaccination and better {COVID}-19 situation in certain countries are unclear, and more data on actual infection rate using {SAR}-{CoV}-2 antibody testing in large population sample is crucial for disease spreading comparison. Two immunological mechanisms, heterologous effects of adaptive immunity and trained innate immunity which induced by {BCG} vaccination, may explain host tolerance against {COVID}-19 infection, however, there is no direct evidence to support this biological background. Clinical trials related to {BCG} vaccination against {COVID}-19 are under investigation. Without a strong evidence, {BCG} must not be recommended for {COVID}-19 prevention, although, this should not be absolute contraindication. Risk of local and systemic complications from the vaccine should be informed to individual, who request {BCG} immunization.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: The {BCG} vaccine, widely used in Brazil in new-borns, induces adjuvant protection for several diseases, including childhood virus infections. {BCG} activates monocytes and innate memory {NK} cells which are crucial for the antiviral immune response. Therefore, strategies to prevent {COVID}-19 in health workers ({HW}) should be carried out to prevent them becoming unwell so that they can continue to work during the pandemic. The hypothesis is that {BCG} will improve the innate immune response and prevent symptomatic infection or {COVID}-19 severity. The primary objective is to verify the effectiveness and safety of the {BCG} vaccine to prevent or reduce incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) infection in the city of Goiânia (Brazil) among {HW} previously vaccinated with {BCG} and also its severity and mortality during the pandemic of the disease. Secondary objectives are to estimate the incidence of {COVID}-19 among these professionals and the innate immune response elicited to {BCG}.
{TRIAL} {DESIGN}: This a phase {II} trial for repositioning {BCG} as a preventive strategy against {COVID}-19. The trial is an open-label, parallel-group randomised clinical trial, comparing {HW} vaccinated with {BCG} and {HW} not vaccinated.
{PARTICIPANTS}: The trial will recruit 800 {HW} of Goiânia - Goiás, Brazil to reach a total of 400 {HW} included after comorbidities questioning and laboratorial evaluation. Eligibility criteria: Any {HW} presenting {BCG} vaccination scar with direct contact with suspected {COVID}-19 patients for at least 8 hours per week, whether in hospital beds, {ICU}, or in transportation or admission (nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, nutritionists, receptionists, etc.) who have negative {IgM} and {IgG} {COVID}-19 test. Participants with any of the following characteristics will be excluded: - Have had in the last fifteen days any signs or symptoms of virus infection, including {COVID}-19; - Have had fever in the last fifteen days; - Have been vaccinated fifteen days before the inclusion; - Have a history or confirmation of any immunosuppressive disease such as {HIV}, presented solid tumour in the last two years or autoimmune diseases; - Are under preventive medication with antibiotics, steroid anti-inflammatories, or chemotherapy; - Have less than 500 neutrophils per {mL} of blood; - Have previously been diagnosed with tuberculosis; - Are breastfeeding or pregnant; - Are younger than 18 years old; - Are participating as an investigator in this clinical trial.
{INTERVENTION} {AND} {COMPARATOR}: {HW} will be randomized into the {BCG} vaccinated group or the {BCG} unvaccinated control group. The {BCG} vaccinated group will receive in the right arm, intradermally, a one off dose of 0.1 {mL} corresponding to approximately 2 x105 to 8 x105 {CFU} of live, freeze-dried, attenuated {BCG} Moscow 361-I, Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine (Serum Institute of India {PVT}. {LTD}.). The unvaccinated control group will not be vaccinated. The {HW} allocated in both groups will be followed up at specific times points until 180 days post inclusion. The vaccinated and control groups will be compared according to {COVID}-19 related outcomes.
{MAIN} {OUTCOMES}: The primary outcomes are the incidence coefficient of infection by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 determined by {RT}-{PCR} of naso-oropharyngeal swab specimen or rapid lateral flow {IgG} and {IgM} test, and presence of general {COVID}-19 symptoms, disease severity and admission to hospital during the 180 days of follow up. The secondary outcome is the innate immune response elicited 15-20 days after vaccination.
{RANDOMISATION}: The vaccine vial contains approximately 10 doses. In order to optimize the vaccine use, the randomisation was performed in blocks of 20 participants using the platform randomization.com [ http://www.jerrydallal.com/random/permute.htm ]. The randomization was prepared before any {HW} inclusion. The results were printed and inserted in sealed envelopes that were numbered with {BCG}-001 to {BCG}-400. The printed results as well the envelopes had the same numbers. At the time of the randomisation, each participant that meets the inclusion criteria will receive a consecutive participant number [{BCG}-001-{BCG}-400]. The sealed envelope with the assigned number, blinded to the researchers, will be opened in front of the participant and the arm allocation will be known.
{BLINDING} ({MASKING}): There is no masking for the participants or for the healthcare providers. The study will be blinded to the laboratory researchers and to those who will be evaluating the outcomes and performing the statistical analyses. In this case, only the participant identification number will be available.
{NUMBERS} {TO} {BE} {RANDOMISED} ({SAMPLE} {SIZE}): Four hundred heath workers will be randomised in two groups. Two hundred participants will be vaccinated, and 200 participants will not be vaccinated.
{TRIAL} {STATUS}: The protocol approved by the Brazilian Ethical Committee is the seventh version, number {CAAE}: 31783720.0.0000.5078. The trial has been recruiting since September 20th, 2020. The clinical trial protocol was registered on August 5th, 2020. It is estimated that recruitment will finish by March 2021.
{TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}: The protocol number was registered on August 5th, 2020 at {REBEC} (Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos). Register number: {RBR}-4kjqtg and {WHO} trial registration number {UTN}: U1111-1256-3892.

Recent studies indicate that both {COVID}-19 incidence and total deaths are strongly associated with the presence or absence of national mandatory {BCG} vaccination programs and encourage the initiation of several clinical studies with the expectation that revaccination with {BCG} could reduce the incidence and severity of {COVID}-19. Here, presented results from the bioinformatics analysis of the Mycobacterium bovis (strain {BCG}/Pasteur 1173P2) proteome suggests four immunodominant antigens that could induce an immune response against {SARS}-{CoV}-2.},

{RESULTS}: The {BCG} vaccine coverage in 1999-2002, 2004, and 2012 in five prefectures with no {COVID}-19 infections was significantly higher than that in five prefectures with a high prevalence of infections (Mann-Whitney U test, p{\textless}0.05). The prevalence of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection was significantly negatively correlated with {BCG} vaccine coverage in 2004 and was significantly positively correlated with age groups 20-34 and 40-54 years (Spearman's rank correlation, p{\textless}0.01).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings suggest that routine infant {BCG} vaccination coverage in young generation had a significant impact on prevention of local {COVID}-19 spread in Japan.},

	abstract = {The vaccine {BCG} has been reported to offer protection against {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. It has been hypothesized this is based on nonspecific enhancement of innate immunity. This study addressed whether there is strong homology between a {SARS}-{CoV}-2 capsid protein and a Mycobacterium bovis protein that would allow for stronger, more specific immune protection. The study also showed the utility of immunohistochemistry in the diagnostic pathology laboratory for elucidating this information. Immunohistochemistry documented that an antibody directed against the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 envelope, but not the spike or membrane proteins, strongly cross hybridized to 11/11 Mycobacterial species tested, including M. bovis. {BlastP} analysis showed high homology of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 envelope protein with 12 consecutive amino acids of the protein {LytR} C, which is a consensus protein unique to Mycobacteria. Six additional cases of human tuberculosis with few organisms showed that the viral envelope specific antibody (5/6) was more accurate than the {AFB} stain (2/6) for diagnostic purposes. These data indicate {BCG} vaccination induces a specific immunity against {SARS} {CoV}-2 that targets the viral envelope protein that is essential for infectivity. Thus, a concurrent booster or first use of the {BCG} vaccine may reduce the severity of the current {COVID}-19 pandemic. The data also suggests the value of using the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 envelope antibody in the diagnosis of Mycobacterial infections in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues by the diagnostic pathologist.},

There is mounting evidence that live attenuated vaccines provide nonspecific protection against lethal infections unrelated to the target pathogen of the vaccine by inducing "trained" nonspecific innate immune cells for improved host responses against subsequent infections. Mortality in {COVID}-19 cases is strongly associated with progressive lung inflammation and eventual sepsis. Vaccination with {MMR} in immunocompetent individuals has no contraindications and may be especially effective for health care workers who can easily be exposed to {COVID}-19. Following the lead of other countries conducting clinical trials with the live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis {BCG} ({BCG}) vaccine under a similar concept, a clinical trial with {MMR} in high-risk populations may provide a "low-risk-high-reward" preventive measure in saving lives during this unprecedented {COVID}-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: The Bacille Calmette-Guérin ({BCG}) vaccine against tuberculosis is associated with non- specific protective effects against other infections, and significant reductions in all-cause morbidity and mortality have been reported. We aim to test whether {BCG} vaccination may reduce susceptibility to and/or the severity of {COVID}-19 and other infectious diseases in health care workers ({HCW}) and thus prevent work absenteeism.The primary objective is to reduce absenteeism due to illness among {HCW} during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. The secondary objectives are to reduce the number of {HCW} that are infected with {SARS}-{CoV}-2, and to reduce the number of hospital admissions among {HCW} during the {COVID}-19 pandemic.
{HYPOTHESIS}: {BCG} vaccination of {HCW} will reduce absenteeism by 20\% over a period of 6 months.
{TRIAL} {DESIGN}: Placebo-controlled, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial, recruiting study participants at several geographic locations. The {BCG} vaccine is used in this study on a different indication than the one it has been approved for by the Danish Medicines Agency, therefore this is classified as a phase {III} study.
{PARTICIPANTS}: The trial will recruit 1,500 {HCW} at Danish hospitals.To be eligible for participation, a subject must meet the following criteria: Adult (≥18 years); Hospital personnel working at a participating hospital for more than 22 hours per week.A potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study: Known allergy to components of the {BCG} vaccine or serious adverse events to prior {BCG} administration Known prior active or latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) or other mycobacterial species Previous confirmed {COVID}-19 Fever ({\textgreater}38 C) within the past 24 hours Suspicion of active viral or bacterial infection Pregnancy Breastfeeding Vaccination with other live attenuated vaccine within the last 4 weeks Severely immunocompromised subjects. This exclusion category comprises: a) subjects with known infection by the human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}-1) b) subjects with solid organ transplantation c) subjects with bone marrow transplantation d) subjects under chemotherapy e) subjects with primary immunodeficiency f) subjects under treatment with any anti-cytokine therapy within the last year g) subjects under treatment with oral or intravenous steroids defined as daily doses of 10 mg prednisone or equivalent for longer than 3 months h) Active solid or non-solid malignancy or lymphoma within the prior two years Direct involvement in the design or the execution of the {BCG}-{DENMARK}-{COVID} trial Intervention and comparator: Participants will be randomised to {BCG} vaccine ({BCG}-Denmark, {AJ} Vaccines, Copenhagen, Denmark) or placebo (saline). An adult dose of 0.1 ml of resuspended {BCG} vaccine (intervention) or 0.1 ml of sterile 0.9\% {NaCl} solution (control) is administered intradermally in the upper deltoid area of the right arm. All participants will receive one injection at inclusion, and no further treatment of study participants will take place.
{MAIN} {OUTCOMES}: Main study endpoint: Days of unplanned absenteeism due to illness within 180 days of randomisation.Secondary study endpoints: The cumulative incidence of documented {COVID}-19 and the cumulative incidence of hospital admission for any reason within 180 days of randomisation.Randomisation: Randomisation will be done centrally using the {REDCap} tool with stratification by hospital, sex and age groups (+/- 45 years of age) in random blocks of 4 and 6. The allocation ratio is 1:1.Blinding (masking): Participants will be blinded to treatment. The participant will be asked to leave the room while the allocated treatment is prepared. Once ready for injection, vaccine and placebo will look similar, and the participant will not be able to tell the difference.The physicians administering the treatment are not blinded.Numbers to be randomised (sample size): Sample size: N=1,500. The 1,500 participants will be randomised 1:1 to {BCG} or placebo with 750 participants in each group.Trial Status: Current protocol version 5.1, from July 6, 2020.Recruitment of study participants started on May 18, 2020 and we anticipate having finished recruiting by the end of December 2020.

Since December 2019, when this outbreak flared in Wuhan, China, {COVID}-19 cases have been continuously rising all over the world. Due to the emergence of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 mutants, subsequent waves are flowing in a faster manner as compared to the primary wave, which is more contagious and causing higher mortality. Recently, India has emerged as the new epicenter of the second wave by mutants of {SARS}-{CoV}-2.

	abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) represents a severe global public health threat. Caused by {SARS}-Cov-2, {COVID}-19 is characterized by high transmission rate that correlates with high viral load. The full clinical spectrum of the illness, the prevalence rates of mild symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and the case fatality rates are still poorly understood, highlighting the importance of early preventive measures. Unfortunately, appropriate vaccination against {SARS}-Cov-2 is not yet available. Unless a target vaccine is developed, {COVID}-19 impacts will be devastating. "Trained immunity" ({TI}), which could be induced by live attenuated vaccines ({LAVs}), is a potential public health preventive approach to boost the host immune system. Trained innate immune cells demonstrated phenotypical and functional changes leading them to acquire immunological memory and amplify their responses against subsequent infections. This phenomenon could have important public health preventive implications by harnessing the early immune responses against {COVID}-19, restricting its progression, and suppressing its infectivity. Some {LAVs} have induced a broad, nonspecific, protection against unrelated pathogens and decreased mortality from conditions other than the targeted infectious diseases. This review summarizes the relevant literature and 1) emphasizes the role of available {LAVs} as potential stimulants for {TI} and 2) proposes this phenomenon as a potential preventive approach against {COVID}-19 that needs thoughtful consideration and further investigation. Clinical trials in this field are then urgently needed in line of vaccine and treatment unavailability. This is specifically true when considering two evolving scenarios; the virus spread may not diminish with warm weather, and that it will erupt a second-hit severe outbreak next winter.},

Thus, evaluating the effectiveness of existing vaccines like Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ({BCG}) has attracted attention. The aim of this review was evidence synthesis on the effect of {BCG} vaccine in preventing severe infectious respiratory disease including {COVD}-19, but not tuberculosis. We considered studies conducted on human participants of any study design from any country setting that were published in Enlgish. We did a systematic literature search in {MEDLINE}, Scopus and Google scholar databases and a free search on Google. The identified studies were appraised and relevant data were extracted using Joanna Briggs Institute tools. The extracted findings were synthesized with tables and narrative summary. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings indicated that {BCG} vaccine has a strong protective effect against both upper and lower acute respiratory tract infections. For instance in countries with universal {BCG} vaccination policy, the incidence of {COVID}-19 was lower compared to the counterparts. Addtionally, {BCG} vaccine was found to protect against infections like lethal influenza A virus, pandemic influenza (H1N1), and other acute respiratory tract infections. {BCG} improved the human body's immune response involving antigen-specific T cells and memory cells. It also induced adaptive functional reprogramming of mononuclear phagocytes that induce protective effects against different respiratory infections other than tuberculosis. In countries with universal {BCG} vaccination, the incidence and death from acute respiratory viral infection including {COVID} - 19 is significantly low. However, there is an urgent need for further evidence from well-designed studies to understand the possible role of {BCG} vaccination over time and across age groups, its possible benefits in special populations such as health workers and cost-savings related to a policy of universal {BCG} vaccination.},

{TRIAL} {DESIGN}: Two separate multi-centre placebo-controlled parallel group randomized trials {PARTICIPANTS}: (1) Health care personnel working in the hospital or ambulance service where they will take care of patients with the {COVID}-19 infection and (2) elderly ≥60 years. The {HCW} trial is being undertaken in 9 hospitals. The elderly trial is being undertaken in locations in the community in Nijmegen, Utrecht, and Veghel, in the Netherlands, using senior citizen organisations to facilitate recruitment.
{INTERVENTION} {AND} {COMPARATOR}: For both trials the intervention group will be randomized to vaccination with 0.1 ml of the licensed {BCG} vaccine (Danish strain 1331, {SSI}, Denmark, equivalent to 0.075 mg attenuated M. bovis). The placebo group consists of 0.1 ml 0.9\% {NaCl}, which is the same amount, and has the same colour and appearance as the suspended {BCG} vaccine.
{MAIN} {OUTCOMES}: (1) Number of days of unplanned work absenteeism in {HCWs} for any reason which can be continuously measured on a bi-weekly basis, and (2) the cumulative incidence of hospital admission due to documented {COVID}-19.

In the absence of specific treatment for {COVID}-19, finding other alternative protection schemes has become another treatment idea. Epidemiological studies have found that, in this {COVID}-19 epidemic, countries with long-term Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ({BCG}) vaccination policies have relatively less cases and lower mortality rates than countries without relevant policies. This phenomenon may be related to the "training immunity" effect of {BCG}.

The 30-day window was adjusted to begin at the country-wise onset of the pandemic. Linear mixed models revealed a significant effect of mandated {BCG} policies on the growth rate of both cases and deaths after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism).

	abstract = {Since its origin in the Wuhan province of China in December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 19 ({COVID}-19) has spread to most parts of the world and has infected millions of people. However, the significant variability in the mortality rate across the world indicates some underlying factors, especially the immunity factors that may have a potential role in this variability. One such factor that is being discussed and tested is the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ({BCG}) vaccine. The available evidence suggests that {BCG} vaccination provides broad protection against respiratory infections as well as other infections. Therefore, {BCG} may prove to be a barrier for {COVID}-19 infection and may offer a ray of hope. In this review, we contrasted {BCG} vaccination program with {COVID}-19 mortality and analyzed trained immunity and cross protection against unrelated pathogens due to {BCG} vaccination. On analyzing the available data, we observed that countries without universal {BCG} vaccination policy are severely affected, while countries having universal {BCG} policies are less affected. Based on these data, we propose that the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 related qualified immunity, cross protection against unrelated pathogens and {COVID}-19 impact variations could be partly explained by the different national policies regarding {BCG} childhood vaccination. The combination of reduced morbidity and mortality may make {BCG} vaccination a potential new tool in the fight against {COVID}-19.},

	abstract = {Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ({BCG}) is a live attenuated M. bovis vaccine that was developed about 100 years ago by Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin. Many countries have been using the vaccine for decades against tuberculosis ({TB}). The World Health Organization ({WHO}) recommends a single dose of {BCG} for infants in {TB} endemic as well as leprosy high risk countries, and globally almost 130 million infants are vaccinated yearly. The role of {BCG} is well known in reducing neonatal and childhood death rates. Epidemiological and retrospective cross-sectional studies demonstrated that the {BCG} vaccination protects the children against respiratory tract infections and lowers the risk of malaria in children. In addition, {BCG} enhances {IFN}-γ and {IL}-10 levels, thus providing immunity against respiratory tract infection even in elderly people. The {BCG} is also known to provide nonspecific innate immunity against viruses and parasites, through an innate immune mechanism termed 'trained immunity' and is defined as the immunological recall of the innate immune system by epigenetic reprogramming. Based on these studies it is suggested that the {BCG} has the potential to act as a protective agent against {COVID}-19. Further proven safety records of {BCG} in humans, its adjuvant activity and low-cost manufacturing make it an attractive option to stop the pandemic and reduce the {COVID}-19 related mortality.

In this interim, the accessibility to the Bacille Calmette-Guerin ({BCG}) may mitigate the pandemic impact in some countries and the {BCG} vaccine offers significant advantages and flexibility in the way clinical vaccines are administered. {BCG} vaccination is a highly cost-effective intervention against tuberculosis ({TB}) and many low-and lower-middle-income countries would likely have the infrastructure, and health care personnel sufficiently familiar with the conventional {TB} vaccine to mount full-scale efforts to administer novel {BCG}-based vaccine for {COVID}-19. This suggests the potential for {BCG} to overcome future barriers to vaccine roll-out in the countries where health systems are fragile and where the effects of this new coronavirus could be catastrophic. Many studies have reported cross-protective effects of the {BCG} vaccine toward non-tuberculosis related diseases. Mechanistically, this cross-protective effect of the {BCG} vaccine can be explained, in part, by trained immunity, a recently discovered program of innate immune memory, which is characterized by non-permanent epigenetic reprogramming of macrophages that leads to increased inflammatory cytokine production and consequently potent immune responses. In this review, we summarize recent work highlighting the potential use of {BCG} for the treatment respiratory infectious diseases and ongoing {SARS}-{CoV}-2 clinical trials. In situations where no other specific prophylactic tools are available, the {BCG} vaccine could be used as a potential adjuvant, to decrease sickness of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection and/or to mitigate the effects of concurrent respiratory infections.},

The virus is distinct from its cousins, {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} in terms of severity of the infection. The obligated killing properties of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus is mediated by its unique structure. Efforts for developing vaccines for {COVID}-19 are ongoing, but it is unlikely to be available in the immediate future. Due to the absence of precise treatment, the investigators are discovering other effective, protective, and healing choices. However, the lower than a predictable number of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 cases in countries with fragile health systems is mystifying. Recently, there has been a buzz about the protective effect of Bacille Calmette-Guérin ({BCG}) vaccine in {COVID}-19 through long-term boosting of trained immunity. Based on epidemiological correlations, we link up that {BCG} vaccination adopted by different countries might influence the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 transmission patterns and/or {COVID}-19 associated mortality through the vaccine's capacity to confer heterologous protection. A number of clinical studies are underway to investigate this possibility but even if they prove effective-many questions will remain. Moreover, responsible stewardship of the {BCG} vaccine in the context of the {COVID}-19 epidemic is directly needed.},

Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ({BCG}) apart from being used as an effective and old vaccine against tuberculosis has some known off-target protection effect and is getting more attention in this scenario. {BCG} confers nonspecific innate immune-boosting effects called trained immunity against secondary infection. Various recent publications have proposed the inverse relationship between the {COVID}-19 morbidity and mortality with that of {BCG} coverage of that country on the basis of epidemiological studies. However, these studies have not considered the confounding factors, and a lot of recent articles are contradicting these epidemiological and observational data.

Although a recent trial has found a protective function of {BCG} against {COVID}-19 in health-care workers, more results of the trials can only give approval on this. There has been a shortage of {BCG} worldwide due to its use in bladder cancer and vaccination in neonates, and hence, its use should be carefully regulated.

Secondly, {BCG} has also been proven to provide benefits in autoimmune diseases by inducing tolerogenicity. Being an acute inflammatory disease, {COVID}-19 requires a therapy that induces early priming of anti-viral immune responses and regulates aberrant hyperactivity of innate-immune cells. Here, we hypothesize that {BCG} can offer reliable spatiotemporal protection from {COVID}-19 by triggering trained immunity and tolerogenesis, through multiple cellular pathways.

Much of these broad spectrum protective effects are attributed to trained immunity, the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells. As {BCG} vaccine is safe, cheap, widely available, amendable to use as a recombinant vector, and immunogenic, it has immense potential for use as an immunotherapeutic agent for various conditions including autoimmune, allergic, neurodegenerative, and neoplastic diseases as well as a preventive measure against infectious agents. Of particular interest is the use of {BCG} vaccination to counteract the increasing prevalence of autoimmune and allergic conditions in industrialized countries attributable to reduced infectious burden as described by the 'hygiene hypothesis.' Furthermore, {BCG} vaccination has been proposed as a potential therapy to mitigate spread and disease burden of {COVID}-19 as a bridge to development of a specific vaccine and recombinant {BCG} expression vectors may prove useful for the introduction of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 antigens ({rBCG}-{SARS}-{CoV}-2) to induce long-term immunity. Understanding the immunomodulatory effects of {BCG} vaccine in these disease contexts is therefore critical.

	abstract = {It has long been known that Bacillus {CalmetteGurin} ({BCG}) vaccine provides nonspecific protection against many non-mycobacterial infections, which has been discussed in the last decade through the prism of the concept of trained immunity. Within the framework of this concept, a persistent increase in resistance to various pathogens, which occurs after an infectious disease or exposure to certain microbial agents, is associated with epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells and their bone marrow progenitors. The {COVID}-19 pandemic has drawn attention of scientists and practitioners to {BCG} as an inducer of trained immunity. A number of epidemiological studies have suggested a negative association between the coverage of the population with {BCG} vaccination and the burden of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. A series of independent clinical studies of the effectiveness of this vaccine in non-specific prevention of {COVID}-19 has been initiated in different countries. Recently, the key role of cytosolic {NOD}2 receptors in {BCG}-induced trained immunity has been proven. This actualizes the search for effective immunoactive preparations for prevention of respiratory infections in the pandemic among low molecular weight peptidoglycan fragments of the bacterial cell wall, muramylpeptides ({MPs}), which are known to be {NOD}2 agonists. The review highlights the proven and proposed linkages between {BCG}, {MPs}, {NOD}2 and trained immunity in the light of the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Analysis of the data presented indicates the prospects for preclinical and clinical studies of {MPs} as potential drugs for nonspecific prevention of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection and/or other respiratory infections in risk groups during the pandemic. First of all, attention should be paid to glucosaminylmuramyl dipeptide, approved for clinical use in Russia and a number of post-Soviet countries for the complex treatment and prevention of acute and recurrent respiratory infections.},

	abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) has become a global pandemic in 2020. The pathogen responsible for the {COVID}-19 has been found to be coronavirus (2019-{nCoV}) with human transmission through droplets, airway secretions, and even direct contact with host. Currently multiple drugs and their combinations are being tried for the treatment of the {COVID}-19 disease, but none approved. In absence of definitive and approved treatment, it is imperative that prevention of {COVID}-19 infection is of utmost importance. For the same, face masks, hand hygiene, isolation, and quarantine are being practiced all over the world. However much successful these methods be, they cannot be used for a very long time. Thus, it becomes necessary that a vaccine be developed for the disease so that the further spread could be halted. Some reports suggest the use of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ({BCG}) vaccine as the prophylaxis for coronavirus. {BCG} vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, used for prophylaxis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is present in the essential list of the World Health Organization as well as immunization programs of many countries. Immunostimulatory antiviral effects of {BCG} vaccine are well known. At present, there are no published evidence available to support the use of {BCG} vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus infection. However, there have been speculations on enhanced immunity with {BCG} vaccine, which might be useful in prevention of coronavirus infection. Results from the clinical studies of {BCG} vaccine in vulnerable population are required to confirm this hypothesis.},

In this issue of the {JCI}, Rivas et al. add to these arguments by showing that {BCG}-vaccinated health care providers from a Los Angeles health care organization had lower rates of {COVID}-19 diagnoses and seropositivity compared with unvaccinated individuals. Prospective clinical trials are thus warranted to explore the effects of {BCG} vaccination in {COVID}-19.

Although recent ecological studies suggested an association between {BCG} policies and the frequency or severity of {COVID}-19 in different countries, the interpretation of these results is challenging. For this reason, a case-control study aiming to test this hypothesis has been initiated in Quebec. Several phase {III} clinical trials are underway, including one in Canada, to assess the efficacy of {BCG} against {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection (results expected in 2021). In the past, {BCG} has been widely used in Canada but current indications are restricted to high-risk individuals and communities experiencing {TB} outbreaks as well as for the treatment of bladder cancer. The potential implication of {BCG} as an interim measure to mitigate {COVID}-19 is the subject of widespread discussion in the scientific community and can be considered for the vulnerable population in Canada. To conclude, {BCG} vaccination should be placed on the agenda of research funding agencies, scientific advisory committees on immunization and federal/provincial/territorial public health authorities.},

	abstract = {During a pandemic, nonspecific immunoprophylaxis of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection and other acute respiratory infections ({ARI}), which can worsen the course of {COVID}-19, is increasingly in demand in addition to specific immunization. {BCG} vaccine appears to be one of the candidate immunostimulants in this regard. At the same time, other microbe-derived preparations capable of inducing a state of trained immunity deserve attention. {BCG} and other bacterial immunostimulatory agents containing a large number of biologically active subunits have long been considered as objects of search for promising pharmacological substances. The review analyzes the linkages between {BCG}, mycobacterial adjuvants, bacterial lysates, trained immunity, muramylpeptides ({MPs}) and {NOD}2 receptors in light of the choice of a low molecular weight alternative to multicomponent bacterial immunostimulants for {ARI} prevention during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. The search for key molecules by which bacteria stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses proceeds in a spiral. On different loops of this spiral, {MPs} have repeatedly reproduced the nonspecific effects of multicomponent bacterial adjuvants, vaccines and immunostimulants. {MPs} and peptidoglycans containing {MPs} determine the adjuvant properties of the cell walls of mycobacteria and their peptide-glycolipid fraction (wax D). {MPs} were able to replace Mycobacterium tuberculosis in complete Freunds adjuvant. {MPs} determine the {NOD}2-dependent ability of {BCG} to induce trained immunity. Probably, {MPs} provide {NOD}2-mediated long-term prophylactic action of bacterial lysates. All of the above has prompted revisiting the previously obtained evidence of the efficacy of glucosaminylmuramyl dipeptide ({GMDP}) as a {NOD}2 agonist in treatment/prevention of respiratory infections. We speculate here that {MPs}, in particular {GMDP}, at rational dosing regimens will be able to reproduce many aspects of the nonspecific effects of {BCG} and multicomponent bacterial immunostimulants in preventing {ARI} during the {COVID}-19 pandemic and in the post-pandemic period.},

With country-level {COVID}-19 outbreak data from Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, and {BCG} program data from World Atlas of {BCG} Policies and Practices and {WHO}/{UNICE}, we estimated a dynamic model to investigate the effect of {BCG} vaccination across time during the pandemic. Our results reconcile these varying reports regarding protection by {BCG} against {COVID}-19 in a variety of clinical scenarios and model specifications. We observe a notable protective effect of the {BCG} vaccine during the early stage of the pandemic. However, we do not see any strong evidence for protection during the later stages. We also see that a higher proportion of vaccinated young population may confer some level of communal protection against the virus in the early pandemic period, even when the proportion of vaccination in the older population is low. Our results highlight that while {BCG} may offer some protection against {COVID}-19, we should be cautious in interpreting the estimated effectiveness as it may vary over time and depend on the age structure of the vaccinated population.},

{METHODS}: Herein, we obtained the latest data from the World Health Organization ({WHO}) as of August 12, 2020, and determined the relationship between three parameters (including the {BCG} vaccination coverage, human development index ({HDI}), and transmission classifications) and the incidence rate and mortality of {COVID}-19.
{RESULTS}: The results showed that the morbidity and mortality of {COVID}-19 in countries with {BCG} vaccination recommendation were significantly lower than these in countries without {BCG} vaccination recommendation, and countries with lower {HDI} have lower morbidity and mortality. In addition, we also found that the mode of virus transmission is also related to the morbidity and mortality of {COVID}-19.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Although our data supports the hypothesis that {BCG} vaccination is beneficial in reducing the morbidity and mortality of {COVID}-19, the data supporting this result may be inaccurate due to many confounders such as {PCR} testing rate, population characteristics, and protection strategies, the reliability of this result still needs to be verified by clinical trials.},

The duration of protection against tuberculosis is estimated to be from 10 to 15 years, but the duration of the protection against other infections is not known, maybe up to 20 years, maybe much shorter than that. We don't know it for sure. {BCG} induced trained immunity paradigm is based on experimental models, cohort studies with low number of individuals, and some epidemiological data in which other possible interfering factors are not controlled. The titles and scopes of scientific articles should be cautiously considered as they can promote indications of getting vaccinated or revaccinated with {BCG}, before its effectiveness is confirmed and recommendations are published. Besides, revaccination with {BCG} can put at serious risk patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency. Maybe {BCG} vaccine is effective in preventing {COVID}-19 deaths or reducing its severity, but may the effect of this vaccine be relevant even with poor health politics and assistance? It is very difficult to compare the epidemiologic data about {COVID}-19 in different countries. There are countless factors, mainly social and related to the healthcare system, which can be more decisive than the hypothesis of trained immunity induced by {BCG}. Until now, we can say that {BCG}'s protective role is, at least, insufficient, given many other factors that corroborate {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection and/or its severity.},

	abstract = {Introduction Non-specific effects of vaccines have gained increasing interest during the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, population use of {BCG} vaccine has been associated with improved outcomes. This study sought to determine the association of population use of {BCG}, adult pneumococcal and adult seasonal influenza vaccination with Covid-19 mortality when adjusted for a number of confounding variables.
Methods Using publicly available data, mortality adjusted for the timeframe of crisis, population size and population characteristics was calculated. The primary analysis was the relationship between each of the day 15 and day 30 standardised mortality rates and {BCG}, adult pneumococcal and influenza vaccination scores using unadjusted measures and with adjustment for population structure and case fatality rates. Secondary analyses were measures of case increases and mortality increases from day 15 to day 30 for each of the relative vaccination scores. Finally, we also analysed the peak Z score reflecting increases in total mortality from historical averages reported by {EuroMOMO} (Euromomo.eu),
Results Following adjustment for the effects of population size, median age, population density, the proportion of population living in an urban setting, life-expectancy, the elderly dependency ratio (or proportion over 65 years), net migration, days from day 1 to lockdown and case-fatality rate, only {BCG} vaccination score remained significantly associated with Covid-19 mortality at day 30. In the best fit model, {BCG} vaccination score was associated with a 64\% reduction in log(10) mortality per 10 million population ({OR} 0.362 reduction [95\% {CI} 0.188 to 0.698]), following adjustment for population size, median age, density, urbanization, elderly dependency ratio, days to lockdown, yearly migration and case fatality rate.
Conclusion {BCG} vaccine was associated with reduced mortality rates in level 4 countries while adult pneumococcal and adult seasonal influenza vaccines were not when adjusted for a number of confounding variables. A number of trials are ongoing to determine if {BCG} is protective against severe Covid-19 infection.},

	abstract = {All viruses, including {SARS}-{CoV}-2, the virus that causes {COVID}-19, change over time. Most changes have little to no impact on the virus’ properties. However, some changes may affect the virus’s properties, such as how easily it spreads, the associated disease severity, or the performance of vaccines, therapeutic medicines, diagnostic tools, or other public health and social measures. {WHO}, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers have been monitoring and assessing the evolution of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 since January 2020. During late 2020, the emergence of variants that posed an increased risk to global public health prompted the characterisation of specific Variants of Interest ({VOIs}) and Variants of Concern ({VOCs}), in order to prioritise global monitoring and research, and ultimately to inform the ongoing response to the {COVID}-19 pandemic.  {WHO} and its international networks of experts are monitoring changes to the virus so that if significant amino acid substitutions are identified, we can inform countries and the public about any changes that may be needed to respond to the variant, and prevent its spread. Globally, systems have been established and are being strengthened to detect “signals” of potential {VOIs} or {VOCs} and assess these based on the risk posed to global public health. National authorities may choose to designate other variants of local interest/concern. Reducing transmission through established and proven disease control methods/measures, as well as avoiding introductions into animal populations, are crucial aspects of the global strategy to reduce the occurrence of mutations that have negative public health implications.Current strategies and measures recommended by {WHO} continue to work against virus variants identified since the start of the pandemic. Evidence from multiple countries with extensive transmission of {VOCs} has indicated that public health and social measures ({PHSM}), including infection prevention and control ({IPC}) measures, have been effective in reducing {COVID}-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. National and local authorities are encouraged to continue strengthening existing {PHSM} and {IPC} measures. Authorities are also encouraged to strengthen surveillance and sequencing capacities and apply a systematic approach to provide a representative indication of the extent of transmission of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants based on the local context, and to detect unusual epidemiological events.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models of transmission have become invaluable management tools in planning for the control of emerging infectious diseases. A key variable in such models is the reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection. Here, we show that these different equations differ only with respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, we obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate. Furthermore, we show that by taking the generation interval distribution equal to the observed distribution, it is possible to obtain an empirical estimate of the reproductive number.},

The aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak. I present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number, which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time, and discuss some potential benefits. Then, to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics, I analyse a model of transmission within and between households, and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number, defined as the number of households infected by each infected household. This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data, and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses. I argue that the household reproduction number is useful in assessing the impact of measures that target the household for isolation, quarantine, vaccination or prophylactic treatment, and measures such as social distancing and school or workplace closures which limit between-household transmission, all of which play a key role in current thinking on future infectious disease mitigation.},

Transmissibility can be measured by the reproduction number R, the average number of secondary cases caused by an infected individual. Several methods have been proposed to estimate R over the course of an epidemic; however, they are usually difficult to implement for people without a strong background in statistical modeling. Here, we present a ready-to-use tool for estimating R from incidence time series, which is implemented in popular software including Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). This tool produces novel, statistically robust analytical estimates of R and incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of the serial interval (the time between the onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of symptoms in secondary cases). We applied the method to 5 historical outbreaks; the resulting estimates of R are consistent with those presented in the literature. This tool should help epidemiologists quantify temporal changes in the transmission intensity of future epidemics by using surveillance data.},

R0 is a derivative of the following variables—the duration of infectivity after the patient gets infected, the likelihood of transmission of infection per contact between a susceptible person and an infectious individual, and the contact rate. R0 is usually estimated retrospectively from serial epidemiological data or using theoretical mathematical models. Epidemiologists can calculate R0 using contact-tracing data, the most common method is to use cumulative incidence data. When mathematical models are used, R0 values are estimated using ordinary differential equations. R0 of {COVID}-19 as initially estimated by the World Health Organization ({WHO}) was between 1.4 and 2.4. The forecast is of critical importance as it will help the governments to have an estimate as well as strategize quickly to avoid any unfavorable condition.},

Previous work has been limited to the assessment of R0 analyzing data from the Wuhan region or Mainland China. In the present study the R0 value for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 was assessed analyzing data derived from the early phase of the outbreak in Italy. In particular, the spread of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 was analyzed in 9 cities (those with the largest number of infections) fitting the well-established {SIR}-model to available data in the interval between February 25–March 12, 2020. The findings of this study suggest that R0 values associated with the Italian outbreak may range from 2.43 to 3.10, confirming previous evidence in the literature reporting similar R0 values for {SARS}-{CoV}-2.},

{AIMS}: To evaluate the role of risk factors in conjunction with {GCT} and to determine an appropriate threshold for the one-hour venous plasma glucose with the {GCT}.
{METHOD}: In a prospective study, 1600 women at antenatal booking without a history of diabetes mellitus or {GDM} filled a form on risk factors before {GCT}. Women who had {GCT} {\textgreater}or= 7.2 mmol/L underwent the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test ({OGTT}). {GDM} was diagnosed according to {WHO} (1999) criteria.
{RESULT}: Thirty-five per cent had {GCT} {\textgreater}or= 7.2 mmol/L, 32.6\% underwent {OGTT} and 34.5\% of {OGTT} confirmed {GDM}. The {GDM} rate in our population was at least 11.4\%. Examination of the receiver operator characteristic curve suggested that the best threshold value for the {GCT} in our population was {\textgreater}or= 7.6 mmol/L. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that only {GCT} {\textgreater}or= 7.6 mmol/L was an independent predictor for {GDM} (adjusted odds ratio 3.7: P {\textless} 0.001). After {GCT}, maternal age and anthropometry, {OGTT} during the third trimester, family history, obstetric history and glycosuria were not independent predictors of {GDM}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Risk factors were not independent predictors of {GDM} in women with {GCT} {\textgreater}or= 7.2 mmol/L. {GCT} threshold value {\textgreater}or= 7.6 mmol is appropriate for the Malaysian population at high risk of {GDM}.},

The sensitivity of the 14–16 week {OGTT} to identify women who would develop {GDM} or have {LGA} babies was low, and we could not identify alternative cut-offs to exclude women not at risk or identify women that could benefit from early intervention. First trimester β-cell function was a stronger determinant than third trimester β-cell function of predicting maternal pre-diabetes. In conclusion, in our normal low-risk population, the 75 g {OGTT} at 14–16 weeks is insufficient to identify candidates for early treatment of {GDM} or identify women not likely to develop {GDM} or have {LGA} babies. First trimester β-cell function may predict pre-diabetes 5 years postpartum.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A safe and efficacious vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2), if deployed with high coverage, could contribute to the control of the {COVID}-19 pandemic. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 vaccine in a pooled interim analysis of four trials.
{METHODS}: This analysis includes data from four ongoing blinded, randomised, controlled trials done across the {UK}, Brazil, and South Africa. Participants aged 18 years and older were randomly assigned (1:1) to {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 vaccine or control (meningococcal group A, C, W, and Y conjugate vaccine or saline). Participants in the {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 group received two doses containing 5 × 1010 viral particles (standard dose; {SD}/{SD} cohort); a subset in the {UK} trial received a half dose as their first dose (low dose) and a standard dose as their second dose ({LD}/{SD} cohort). The primary efficacy analysis included symptomatic {COVID}-19 in seronegative participants with a nucleic acid amplification test-positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to treatment received, with data cutoff on Nov 4, 2020. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1 - relative risk derived from a robust Poisson regression model adjusted for age. Studies are registered at {ISRCTN}89951424 and {ClinicalTrials}.gov, {NCT}04324606, {NCT}04400838, and {NCT}04444674.
{FINDINGS}: Between April 23 and Nov 4, 2020, 23 848 participants were enrolled and 11 636 participants (7548 in the {UK}, 4088 in Brazil) were included in the interim primary efficacy analysis. In participants who received two standard doses, vaccine efficacy was 62·1\% (95\% {CI} 41·0-75·7; 27 [0·6\%] of 4440 in the {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 group vs71 [1·6\%] of 4455 in the control group) and in participants who received a low dose followed by a standard dose, efficacy was 90·0\% (67·4-97·0; three [0·2\%] of 1367 vs 30 [2·2\%] of 1374; pinteraction=0·010). Overall vaccine efficacy across both groups was 70·4\% (95·8\% {CI} 54·8-80·6; 30 [0·5\%] of 5807 vs 101 [1·7\%] of 5829). From 21 days after the first dose, there were ten cases hospitalised for {COVID}-19, all in the control arm; two were classified as severe {COVID}-19, including one death. There were 74 341 person-months of safety follow-up (median 3·4 months, {IQR} 1·3-4·8): 175 severe adverse events occurred in 168 participants, 84 events in the {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 group and 91 in the control group. Three events were classified as possibly related to a vaccine: one in the {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 group, one in the control group, and one in a participant who remains masked to group allocation.
{INTERPRETATION}: {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 has an acceptable safety profile and has been found to be efficacious against symptomatic {COVID}-19 in this interim analysis of ongoing clinical trials.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A heterologous recombinant adenovirus ({rAd})-based vaccine, Gam-{COVID}-Vac (Sputnik V), showed a good safety profile and induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses in participants in phase 1/2 clinical trials. Here, we report preliminary results on the efficacy and safety of Gam-{COVID}-Vac from the interim analysis of this phase 3 trial.
{METHODS}: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 25 hospitals and polyclinics in Moscow, Russia. We included participants aged at least 18 years, with negative {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {PCR} and {IgG} and {IgM} tests, no infectious diseases in the 14 days before enrolment, and no other vaccinations in the 30 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo, with stratification by age group. Investigators, participants, and all study staff were masked to group assignment. The vaccine was administered (0·5 {mL}/dose) intramuscularly in a prime-boost regimen: a 21-day interval between the first dose ({rAd}26) and the second dose ({rAd}5), both vectors carrying the gene for the full-length {SARS}-{CoV}-2 glycoprotein S. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with {PCR}-confirmed {COVID}-19 from day 21 after receiving the first dose. All analyses excluded participants with protocol violations: the primary outcome was assessed in participants who had received two doses of vaccine or placebo, serious adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received at least one dose at the time of database lock, and rare adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received two doses and for whom all available data were verified in the case report form at the time of database lock. The trial is registered at {ClinicalTrials}.gov ({NCT}04530396).
{FINDINGS}: Between Sept 7 and Nov 24, 2020, 21 977 adults were randomly assigned to the vaccine group (n=16 501) or the placebo group (n=5476). 19 866 received two doses of vaccine or placebo and were included in the primary outcome analysis. From 21 days after the first dose of vaccine (the day of dose 2), 16 (0·1\%) of 14 964 participants in the vaccine group and 62 (1·3\%) of 4902 in the placebo group were confirmed to have {COVID}-19; vaccine efficacy was 91·6\% (95\% {CI} 85·6-95·2). Most reported adverse events were grade 1 (7485 [94·0\%] of 7966 total events). 45 (0·3\%) of 16 427 participants in the vaccine group and 23 (0·4\%) of 5435 participants in the placebo group had serious adverse events; none were considered associated with vaccination, with confirmation from the independent data monitoring committee. Four deaths were reported during the study (three [{\textless}0·1\%] of 16 427 participants in the vaccine group and one [{\textless}0·1\%] of 5435 participants in the placebo group), none of which were considered related to the vaccine.
{INTERPRETATION}: This interim analysis of the phase 3 trial of Gam-{COVID}-Vac showed 91·6\% efficacy against {COVID}-19 and was well tolerated in a large cohort.

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the effectiveness of the modelling approach on the pandemic due to the spreading of the novel {COVID}-19 disease and develop a susceptible-infected-removed ({SIR}) model that provides a theoretical framework to investigate its spread within a community. Here, the model is based upon the well-known susceptible-infected-removed ({SIR}) model with the difference that a total population is not defined or kept constant per se and the number of susceptible individuals does not decline monotonically. To the contrary, as we show herein, it can be increased in surge periods! In particular, we investigate the time evolution of different populations and monitor diverse significant parameters for the spread of the disease in various communities, represented by China, South Korea, India, Australia, {USA}, Italy and the state of Texas in the {USA}. The {SIR} model can provide us with insights and predictions of the spread of the virus in communities that the recorded data alone cannot. Our work shows the importance of modelling the spread of {COVID}-19 by the {SIR} model that we propose here, as it can help to assess the impact of the disease by offering valuable predictions. Our analysis takes into account data from January to June, 2020, the period that contains the data before and during the implementation of strict and control measures. We propose predictions on various parameters related to the spread of {COVID}-19 and on the number of susceptible, infected and removed populations until September 2020. By comparing the recorded data with the data from our modelling approaches, we deduce that the spread of {COVID}-19 can be under control in all communities considered, if proper restrictions and strong policies are implemented to control the infection rates early from the spread of the disease.},

	abstract = {When trying to learn a model for the prediction of an outcome given a set of covariates, a statistician has many estimation procedures in their toolbox. A few examples of these candidate learners are: least squares, least angle regression, random forests, and spline regression. Previous articles (van der Laan and Dudoit (2003); van der Laan et al. (2006); Sinisi et al. (2007)) theoretically validated the use of cross validation to select an optimal learner among many candidate learners. Motivated by this use of cross validation, we propose a new prediction method for creating a weighted combination of many candidate learners to build the super learner. This article proposes a fast algorithm for constructing a super learner in prediction which uses V-fold cross-validation to select weights to combine an initial set of candidate learners. In addition, this paper contains a practical demonstration of the adaptivity of this so called super learner to various true data generating distributions. This approach for construction of a super learner generalizes to any parameter which can be defined as a minimizer of a loss function.},

	abstract = {{AIMS}: Delays in breast cancer care, one important attributable factor for breast cancer being diagnosed at advanced stages, are not systematically studied in many countries. This study assessed the magnitude and factors associated with delays in breast cancer care in Sri Lanka, from symptom detection to treatment initiation.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: We interviewed 800 consecutively sampled female breast cancer patients, diagnosed within the last 12 months, using context-specific questionnaires and medical records. We defined the cut-off times for delays using international guidelines and features of the national health system and care-seeking patterns in the country. Delays were estimated as proportions with 95\% confidence intervals and presented for: (i) presentation delay; (ii) diagnosis delay and (iii) treatment delay. We looked at how sociodemographic and healthcare availability and accessibility at the individual level were associated with delays using multivariate logistic regression, with a P value of 0.05 to define statistical significance.
{RESULTS}: Nearly two-thirds of patients reported a presentation delay (63.3\%, 95\% confidence interval 59.9-66.6\%). A diagnosis delay (36.7\%, 95\% confidence interval 33.4-40.0\%) was also seen among one-third, whereas treatment delays (13.2\%, 95\% confidence interval 10.8-15.5\%) were less common. Low family monthly income (odds ratio 6.3; 95\% confidence interval 4.2-9.3) and poor knowledge on breast cancer (odds ratio 2.7; 95\% confidence interval 1.8-3.8) were associated with presentation delay. Poor health literacy (odds ratio 1.7; 95\% confidence interval 1.1-2.7) and the need to make more than two visits to the first contact health provider prior to diagnosis (odds ratio 7.2; 95\% confidence interval 4.6-11.1) were associated with diagnosis delays, whereas directly contacting an appropriate specialised health provider once the lump was detected reduced diagnosis delay (odds ratio 0.3; 95\% confidence interval 0.2-0.4). Having undergone a core biopsy (odds ratio 0.5; 95\% confidence interval 0.3-0.8) and having a mammogram (odds ratio 0.6; 95\% confidence interval 4.7-32.7) reduced the likelihood of treatment delays.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our study findings show that delays in breast cancer care in Sri Lanka are much lower than those in other lower-middle income countries. However, there is significant room for improvement, especially in relation to the excellence in quality of care, such as improving access to mammography services. Periodical estimation of breast cancer delays enabling temporal comparisons will probably provide useful information to policy makers in improving care delivery for breast cancer patients and, hence, is recommended. Such future assessments designed for comparisons between different treatment modalities would provide more information to assist policy decisions in care improvement.},

	abstract = {Background
In an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study ({GBD}) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries.

Methods
{GBD} estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost ({YLLs}), years lived with disability ({YLDs}), and disability-adjusted life-years ({DALYs}) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories. Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources. Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the {GBD} population, fertility, and mortality estimates. Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate {YLLs}. A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, {DisMod}-{MR} 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate {YLDs}. We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index ({SDI}), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years. Uncertainty intervals ({UIs}) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution.

Findings
Global health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised {DALY} rates. After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of {DALYs} has remained stable. Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised {DALY} rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990–2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0–9-year age group. Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of {DALYs} in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth). In adolescents aged 10–24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of {DALYs}: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth). Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10–24 years were also in the top ten in the 25–49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), {HIV}/{AIDS} (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth). In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of {DALYs} in both the 50–74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups. Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to {YLDs} from non-communicable diseases and injuries. In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury {YLDs} constituted more than half of all disease burden. Decreases in age-standardised {DALY} rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the {SDI} range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher {SDI}.

Interpretation
As disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies. With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes. The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.

Second, the value of time lived at different ages is captured in {DALYs} using an exponential function which reflects the dependence of the young and the elderly on adults. Third, the time lived with a disability is made comparable with the time lost due to premature mortality by defining six classes of disability severity. Assigned to each class is a severity weight between 0 and 1. Finally, a three percent discount rate is used in the calculation of {DALYs}.

	abstract = {Background There is disagreement about the level of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) infection. We conducted a living systematic review and meta-analysis to address three questions: (1) Amongst people who become infected with {SARS}-{CoV}-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? (2) Amongst people with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? (3) What proportion of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection or presymptomatic? Methods and findings We searched {PubMed}, Embase, {bioRxiv}, and {medRxiv} using a database of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 literature that is updated daily, on 25 March 2020, 20 April 2020, and 10 June 2020. Studies of people with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase {PCR} ({RT}-{PCR}) that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up or modelling studies were included. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with an adapted checklist for case series, and the relevance and credibility of modelling studies were assessed using a published checklist. We included a total of 94 studies. The overall estimate of the proportion of people who become infected with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and remain asymptomatic throughout infection was 20\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 17–25) with a prediction interval of 3\%–67\% in 79 studies that addressed this review question. There was some evidence that biases in the selection of participants influence the estimate. In seven studies of defined populations screened for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and then followed, 31\% (95\% {CI} 26\%–37\%, prediction interval 24\%–38\%) remained asymptomatic. The proportion of people that is presymptomatic could not be summarised, owing to heterogeneity. The secondary attack rate was lower in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection than those with symptomatic infection (relative risk 0.35, 95\% {CI} 0.10–1.27). Modelling studies fit to data found a higher proportion of all {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infections resulting from transmission from presymptomatic individuals than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the review include that most included studies were not designed to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infections and were at risk of selection biases; we did not consider the possible impact of false negative {RT}-{PCR} results, which would underestimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections; and the database does not include all sources. Conclusions The findings of this living systematic review suggest that most people who become infected with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 will not remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection. The contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall {SARS}-{CoV}-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand hygiene, masks, testing tracing, and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed.},

	abstract = {{COVID}-19 has affected all countries. Its containment represents a unique challenge for India due to a large population ({\textgreater} 1.38 billion) across a wide range of population densities. Assessment of the {COVID}-19 disease burden is required to put the disease impact into context and support future pandemic policy development. Here, we present the national-level burden of {COVID}-19 in India in 2020 that accounts for differences across urban and rural regions and across age groups. Input data were collected from official records or published literature. The proportion of excess {COVID}-19 deaths was estimated using the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Washington data. Disability-adjusted life years ({DALY}) due to {COVID}-19 were estimated in the Indian population in 2020, comprised of years of life lost ({YLL}) and years lived with disability ({YLD}). {YLL} was estimated by multiplying the number of deaths due to {COVID}-19 by the residual standard life expectancy at the age of death due to the disease. {YLD} was calculated as a product of the number of incident cases of {COVID}-19, disease duration and disability weight. Scenario analyses were conducted to account for excess deaths not recorded in the official data and for reported {COVID}-19 deaths. The direct impact of {COVID}-19 in 2020 in India was responsible for 14,100,422 (95\% uncertainty interval [{UI}] 14,030,129–14,213,231) {DALYs}, consisting of 99.2\% (95\% {UI} 98.47–99.64\%) {YLLs} and 0.80\% (95\% {UI} 0.36–1.53) {YLDs}. {DALYs} were higher in urban (56\%; 95\% {UI} 56–57\%) than rural areas (44\%; 95\% {UI} 43.4–43.6) and in men (64\%) than women (36\%). In absolute terms, the highest {DALYs} occurred in the 51–60-year-old age group (28\%) but the highest {DALYs} per 100,000 persons were estimated for the 71–80 years old age group (5481; 95\% {UI} 5464–5500 years). There were 4,815,908 (95\% {UI} 4,760,908–4,924,307) {DALYs} after considering reported {COVID}-19 deaths only. The {DALY} estimations have direct and immediate implications not only for public policy in India, but also internationally given that India represents one sixth of the world’s population.},

As the population of patients recovering from {COVID}-19 grows, it is paramount to establish an understanding of the healthcare issues surrounding them. {COVID}-19 is now recognized as a multi-organ disease with a broad spectrum of manifestations. Similarly to post-acute viral syndromes described in survivors of other virulent coronavirus epidemics, there are increasing reports of persistent and prolonged effects after acute {COVID}-19. Patient advocacy groups, many members of which identify themselves as long haulers, have helped contribute to the recognition of post-acute {COVID}-19, a syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms and/or delayed or long-term complications beyond 4 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the current literature on post-acute {COVID}-19, its pathophysiology and its organ-specific sequelae. Finally, we discuss relevant considerations for the multidisciplinary care of {COVID}-19 survivors and propose a framework for the identification of those at high risk for post-acute {COVID}-19 and their coordinated management through dedicated {COVID}-19 clinics.},

	abstract = {Background
Post-acute coronavirus 2019 ({COVID}-19) syndrome is now recognized as a complex systemic disease that is associated with substantial morbidity.

Objectives
To estimate the prevalence of persistent symptoms and signs at least 12 weeks after acute {COVID}-19 at different follow-up periods.

Data sources
Searches were conducted up to October 2021 in Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, and {PubMed}.

Study eligibility criteria, participants and interventions
Articles in English that reported the prevalence of persistent symptoms among individuals with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and included at least 50 patients with a follow-up of at least 12 weeks after acute illness.

Methods
Random-effect meta-analysis was performed to produce a pooled prevalence for each symptom at four different follow-up time intervals. Between-study heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic and was explored via meta-regression, considering several a priori study-level variables. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for prevalence studies and comparative studies, respectively.

Results
After screening 3209 studies, a total of 63 studies were eligible, with a total {COVID}-19 population of 257 348. The most commonly reported symptoms were fatigue, dyspnea, sleep disorder, and difficulty concentrating (32\%, 25\%, 24\%, and 22\%, respectively, at 3- to {\textless}6-month follow-up); effort intolerance, fatigue, sleep disorder, and dyspnea (45\%, 36\%, 29\%, and 25\%, respectively, at 6- to {\textless}9-month follow-up); fatigue (37\%) and dyspnea (21\%) at 9 to {\textless}12 months; and fatigue, dyspnea, sleep disorder, and myalgia (41\%, 31\%, 30\%, and 22\%, respectively, at {\textgreater}12-month follow-up). There was substantial between-study heterogeneity for all reported symptom prevalences. Meta-regressions identified statistically significant effect modifiers: world region, male sex, diabetes mellitus, disease severity, and overall study quality score. Five of six studies including a comparator group consisting of {COVID}-19–negative cases observed significant adjusted associations between {COVID}-19 and several long-term symptoms.

Conclusions
This systematic review found that a large proportion of patients experience post-acute {COVID}-19 syndrome 3 to 12 months after recovery from the acute phase of {COVID}-19. However, available studies of post-acute {COVID}-19 syndrome are highly heterogeneous. Future studies need to have appropriate comparator groups, standardized symptom definitions and measurements, and longer follow-up.},

That study suggested that comparative assessments of different health outcomes are broadly similar across settings, but the significance of this conclusion has been debated. The aim of the present study was to estimate disability weights for Europe for a set of 255 health states, including 43 new health states, by replicating the {GBD} 2010 Disability Weights Measurement study among representative population samples from four European countries. For the assessment of disability weights for Europe we applied the {GBD} 2010 disability weights measurement approach in web-based sample surveys in Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, and Sweden. The survey included paired comparisons ({PC}) and population health equivalence questions ({PHE}) formulated as discrete choices. Probit regression analysis was used to estimate cardinal values from {PC} responses. To locate results onto the 0-to-1 disability weight scale, we assessed the feasibility of using the {GBD} 2010 scaling approach based on {PHE} questions, as well as an alternative approach using non-parametric regression. In total, 30,660 respondents participated in the survey. Comparison of the probit regression results from the {PC} responses for each country indicated high linear correlations between countries. The {PHE} data had high levels of measurement error in these general population samples, which compromises the ability to infer ratio-scaled values from discrete choice responses. Using the non-parametric regression approach as an alternative rescaling procedure, the set of disability weights were bounded by distance vision mild impairment and anemia with the lowest weight (0.004) and severe multiple sclerosis with the highest weight (0.677). {PC} assessments of health outcomes in this study resulted in estimates that were highly correlated across four European countries. Assessment of the feasibility of rescaling based on a discrete choice formulation of the {PHE} question indicated that this approach may not be suitable for use in a web-based survey of the general population.},

	abstract = {31 Dec 2019China reported a cluster of cases of in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel coronavirus was eventually identified.1 January 2020WHO had set up the {IMST} (Incident Management Support Team) across the three levels of the organization: headquarters, regional headquarters and country level, putting the organization on an emergency footing for dealing with the outbreak.4  January 2020WHO reported on social media that there was a cluster of pneumonia cases – with no deaths – in Wuhan, Hubei province. 5 January 2020WHO published our first Disease Outbreak News on the new virus. This is a flagship technical publication to the scientific and public health community as well as global media. It contained a risk assessment and advice, and reported on what China had told the organization about the status of patients and the public health response on the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.10 January 2020WHO issued a comprehensive package of technical guidance online with advice to all countries on how to detect, test and manage potential cases, based on what was known about the virus at the time. Evidence at that time suggested there was “no or limited human-to-human transmission.” Based on experience with {SARS} and {MERS} and known modes of transmission of respiratory viruses, infection and prevention control guidance were published to protect health workers recommending droplet and contact precautions when caring for patients, and airborne precautions for aerosol generating procedures conducted by health workers.  12 January 2020China shared the genetic sequence of {COVID}-19. 13 January 2020Officials confirm case of {COVID}-19 in Thailand, the first recorded case outside of China.   14 January 2020 Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove noted in a press briefing there had been limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus (in the 41 confirmed cases), mainly through family members, and that there was a risk of a possible wider outbreak. Dr. Kerkhove noted that human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given our experience with {SARS}, {MERS} and other respiratory pathogens.  20-21 January 2020WHO experts from its China and Western Pacific regional offices conducted a brief field visit to Wuhan.22 January 2020WHO mission to China issued a statement saying that there was evidence of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan but more investigation was needed to understand the full extent of transmission.22- 23 January 2020The {WHO} Director- General convened an Emergency Committee ({EC}) under the International Health Regulations ({IHR} 2005) to assess whether the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern. The independent members from around the world could not reach a consensus based on the evidence available at the time. They asked to be reconvened within 10 days after receiving more information.28 January 2020A senior {WHO} delegation led by the Director-General travelled to Beijing to meet China’s leadership, learn more about China’s response, and to offer any technical assistance.  While in Beijing, Dr. Tedros agreed with Chinese government leaders that an international team of leading scientists would travel to China on a mission to better understand the context, the overall response, and exchange information and experience. 11-12 February 2020WHO convened a Research and Innovation Forum on {COVID}-19, attended by more than 400 experts and funders from around the world, which included presentations by George Gao, Director General of China {CDC}, and Zunyou Wu, China {CDC}'s chief epidemiologist. 16-24 February 2020The {WHO}-China Joint mission, which included experts from Canada, Germany, Japan, Nigeria, Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore and the {US} ({CDC}, {NIH}) spent time in Beijing and also travelled to Wuhan and two other cities. They spoke with health officials, scientists and health workers in health facilities (maintaining physical distancing).

All {COVID}-19 estimates were for 2020. In 2020, estimates of {COVID}-19 {DALYs} in Scotland ranged from 96,500 to 108,200. Direct {COVID}-19 {DALYs} were substantial enough to be framed as the second leading cause of disease and injury, with only ischaemic heart disease having a larger impact on population health. Mortality contributed 98\% of total {DALYs}. The direct population health impact of {COVID}-19 has been very substantial. Despite unprecedented mitigation efforts, {COVID}-19 developed from a single identified case in early 2020 to a condition with an impact in Scotland second only to ischaemic heart disease. Periodic estimation of {DALYs} during 2021, and beyond, will provide indications of the impact of {DALYs} averted due to the national rollout of the vaccination programme and other continued mitigation efforts, although new variants may pose significant challenges.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The {SARS}-{CoV}-2 pandemic presented major challenges to the health sector in 2020. The burden of disease arising from {COVID}-19 can be expressed as the number of years of life lost to disease or death. For example, death at age 40 involves a loss of far more years of life than death at age 80.
{METHODS}: The disability-adjusted life years ({DALY}) lost to {COVID}-19 were calculated as the sum of the years of life lost through death ({YLL}) and the number of years lived with disability ({YLD}), on the basis of laboratory-confirmed notifiable cases of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection in Germany in 2020 (documented as of 18 January 2021). The methodology was based on that used in the Global Burden of Disease Study. Pre-existing diseases do not enter into the determination of {YLL}; rather, the residual life expectancy that is applied in this calculation corresponds to a mean age-specific level of morbidity.
{RESULTS}: 305 641 years of life were lost to {COVID}-19 in Germany in 2020. The percentage of {DALY} lost by persons under 70 was 34.8\% in men and 21.0\% in women. 99.3\% of the {COVID}-19 disease burden was accounted for by death ({YLL}). The daily average years of life lost due to death was lower for {COVID}-19 than for the major non-communicable diseases. Persons who died of {COVID}-19 lost a mean of 9.6 years of life; those who were under 70 when they died lost a mean of 25.2 years of life. Men lost more years of life than women (11.0 vs. 8.1 years).
{CONCLUSION}: The effects of {COVID}-19 on public health can be expressed through the burden of disease indicators. This method yields additional information that should be put to use early in the course of future outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Background
Global burden of {COVID}-19 has not been well studied, disability-adjusted life years ({DALYs}) and value of statistical life ({VSL}) metrics were therefore proposed to quantify its impacts on health and economic loss globally.

Methods
The life expectancy, cases, and death numbers of {COVID}-19 until 30th April 2021 were retrieved from open data to derive the epidemiological profiles and {DALYs} (including years of life lost ({YLL}) and years loss due to disability ({YLD})) by four periods. The {VSL} estimates were estimated by using hedonic wage method ({HWM}) and contingent valuation method ({CVM}). The estimate of willingness to pay using {CVM} was based on the meta-regression mixed model. Machine learning method was used for classification.

Results
Globally, {DALYs} (in thousands) due to {COVID}-19 was tallied as 31,930 from Period I to {IV}. {YLL} dominated over {YLD}. The estimates of {VSL} were {US}\$591 billion and {US}\$5135 billion based on {HWM} and {CVM}, respectively. The estimate of {VSL} increased from {US}\$579 billion in Period I to {US}\$2160 billion in Period {IV} using {CVM}. The higher the human development index ({HDI}), the higher the value of {DALYs} and {VSL}. However, there exits the disparity even at the same level of {HDI}. Machine learning analysis categorized eight patterns of global burden of {COVID}-19 with a large variation from {US}\$0.001 billion to {US}\$691.4 billion.

Conclusion
Global burden of {COVID}-19 pandemic resulted in substantial health and value of life loss particularly in developed economies. Classifications of such health and economic loss is informative to early preparation of adequate resource to reduce impacts.},

The estimates were generated by applying mathematical models to 159 countries and territories. The percentage of the world's population that has been infected as of 31 December 2020 was estimated at 12.56\% (95\% {CI}: 11.17-14.05\%).

If left unchecked with no vaccination and no other public health interventions, and assuming circulation of only wild-type variants and no variants of concern, the pandemic would eventually cause 8.18 million deaths (95\% {CI}: 7.30-9.18), 163.67 million acute-care hospitalizations (95\% {CI}: 148.12-179.51), and 33.01 million {ICU} hospitalizations (95\% {CI}: 30.52-35.70), by the time the herd immunity threshold is reached at 60-70\% infection exposure.

	abstract = {Background and Aims
Older people have higher rates of comorbidities and may experience more severe inflammatory responses; therefore, are at higher risk of death. Herein, we aimed to systematically review the mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}‐19) patients and its predictors in this age group.

Methods
We searched {PubMed}, Web of Science, and Science Direct using relevant keywords. Retrieved records underwent a two‐step screening process consisting of title/abstract and full‐text screenings to identify the eligible studies.

Results
Summarizing findings of 35 studies demonstrated that older patients have higher mortality rates compared to the younger population. A review of articles revealed that increasing age, body mass index, a male gender, dementia, impairment or dependency in daily activities, presence of consolidations on chest X‐ray, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and lower oxygen saturation at admission were risk factors for death. High d‐dimer levels, 25‐hydroxy vitamin D serum deficiencies, high C‐reactive protein (≥5 mg/L) levels plus any other abnormalities of lymphocyte, higher blood urea nitrogen or lactate dehydrogenase, and higher platelet count were predictors of poor prognosis and mortality in the elderly. Studies have also shown that previous treatment with renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors, pharmacological treatments of respiratory disorders, antibiotics, corticosteroids, vitamin K antagonist, antihistamines, azithromycin, Itolizumab (an anti‐{CD}6 monoclonal antibody) in combination with other antivirals reduces {COVID}‐19 worsening and mortality. Vaccination against seasonal influenza might also reduce {COVID}‐19 mortality.

Conclusion
Overall, a critical consideration is necessary for the care and management of {COVID}‐19 in the aged population considering the drastic contrasts in manifestation and prognosis compared to other age groups. Mortality from {COVID}‐19 is independently associated with the patient's age. Elderly patients with {COVID}‐19 are more vulnerable to poor outcomes. Thus, strict preventive measures, timely diagnosis, and aggressive therapeutic/nontherapeutic care are of great importance to reduce acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe complications in older people.},

	abstract = {The Coronavirus ({COVID}-19) crisis has dealt a significant shock to Sri Lanka’s economy and people. This note examines the expected impact on poverty and inequality amid widespread job and earnings losses. While poverty was relatively low in Sri Lanka prior to the pandemic, pre-existing vulnerabilities were high, partly owing to high levels of informality. Many workers do not have access to employment protection or other job-related social protection benefits, making them vulnerable during times of economic crisis. Livelihoods support programs and various relief measures implemented by the government over the course of the pandemic are expected to have mitigated the labor market shock. Inequality is expected to increase in the short run because of the unequal distribution of the shock. Moreover, reduced social mobility as a consequence of widening disparities in access to education for example could increase inequality in the long term. Policy measures could aim to strike a balance between those that support a resilient recovery and those that aim to include the most vulnerable in the recovery process. Achieving this balance will help reverse the impact of the pandemic and mitigate its consequences for inequality. Shifting toward a more adaptive social protection system would allow much needed support to be scaled up quickly and effectively in times of crisis.},

	abstract = {{COVID}-19 has affected all countries. Its containment represents a unique challenge for India due to a large population ({\textgreater} 1.38 billion) across a wide range of population densities. Assessment of the {COVID}-19 disease burden is required to put the disease impact into context and support future pandemic policy development. Here, we present the national-level burden of {COVID}-19 in India in 2020 that accounts for differences across urban and rural regions and across age groups. Input data were collected from official records or published literature. The proportion of excess {COVID}-19 deaths was estimated using the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Washington data. Disability-adjusted life years ({DALY}) due to {COVID}-19 were estimated in the Indian population in 2020, comprised of years of life lost ({YLL}) and years lived with disability ({YLD}). {YLL} was estimated by multiplying the number of deaths due to {COVID}-19 by the residual standard life expectancy at the age of death due to the disease. {YLD} was calculated as a product of the number of incident cases of {COVID}-19, disease duration and disability weight. Scenario analyses were conducted to account for excess deaths not recorded in the official data and for reported {COVID}-19 deaths. The direct impact of {COVID}-19 in 2020 in India was responsible for 14,100,422 (95\% uncertainty interval [{UI}] 14,030,129–14,213,231) {DALYs}, consisting of 99.2\% (95\% {UI} 98.47–99.64\%) {YLLs} and 0.80\% (95\% {UI} 0.36–1.53) {YLDs}. {DALYs} were higher in urban (56\%; 95\% {UI} 56–57\%) than rural areas (44\%; 95\% {UI} 43.4–43.6) and in men (64\%) than women (36\%). In absolute terms, the highest {DALYs} occurred in the 51–60-year-old age group (28\%) but the highest {DALYs} per 100,000 persons were estimated for the 71–80 years old age group (5481; 95\% {UI} 5464–5500 years). There were 4,815,908 (95\% {UI} 4,760,908–4,924,307) {DALYs} after considering reported {COVID}-19 deaths only. The {DALY} estimations have direct and immediate implications not only for public policy in India, but also internationally given that India represents one sixth of the world’s population.},

	abstract = {Background
Global burden of {COVID}-19 has not been well studied, disability-adjusted life years ({DALYs}) and value of statistical life ({VSL}) metrics were therefore proposed to quantify its impacts on health and economic loss globally.

Methods
The life expectancy, cases, and death numbers of {COVID}-19 until 30th April 2021 were retrieved from open data to derive the epidemiological profiles and {DALYs} (including years of life lost ({YLL}) and years loss due to disability ({YLD})) by four periods. The {VSL} estimates were estimated by using hedonic wage method ({HWM}) and contingent valuation method ({CVM}). The estimate of willingness to pay using {CVM} was based on the meta-regression mixed model. Machine learning method was used for classification.

Results
Globally, {DALYs} (in thousands) due to {COVID}-19 was tallied as 31,930 from Period I to {IV}. {YLL} dominated over {YLD}. The estimates of {VSL} were {US}\$591 billion and {US}\$5135 billion based on {HWM} and {CVM}, respectively. The estimate of {VSL} increased from {US}\$579 billion in Period I to {US}\$2160 billion in Period {IV} using {CVM}. The higher the human development index ({HDI}), the higher the value of {DALYs} and {VSL}. However, there exits the disparity even at the same level of {HDI}. Machine learning analysis categorized eight patterns of global burden of {COVID}-19 with a large variation from {US}\$0.001 billion to {US}\$691.4 billion.

Conclusion
Global burden of {COVID}-19 pandemic resulted in substantial health and value of life loss particularly in developed economies. Classifications of such health and economic loss is informative to early preparation of adequate resource to reduce impacts.},

	shorttitle = {Sri Lanka’s early success in the containment of {COVID}-19 through its rapid response},
	abstract = {Background Despite the rising global burden, Sri Lanka reported a relatively low caseload and mortality (13 deaths as of 20 October 2020) for {COVID}-19. This warrants exploration of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the case series during the initial passive case detection phase in Sri Lanka, in order to understand the success in containment of the disease for more than nine months in the country through its initial early and rapid pandemic response. Methods A retrospective study was conducted using secondary data (hospital records and investigation reports) extracted from all laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to the three main state-sector hospitals in Sri Lanka from 11 March to 7 April 2020. Clinical outcomes were categorized as mild, severe and critical, as per the international classification. Kruskal-Wallis H, Mann Whitney U and Fisher’s exact tests compared differences between the variables. Results The case series comprised 146 live discharges and six deaths. Majority were males (63.2\%); mean age of 40.9 ({SD} = 17.9); and symptomatic (72.4\%). Sixty-one (40.1\%) had co-morbidities, the commonest being diabetes (20.4\%) and hypertension (17.8\%). Mild (93.4\%), severe (2.6\%) and critical (4.0\%) disease outcomes were noted. Disease severity was significantly higher with older age (p = 0.037), co-morbidities (p = 0.026); and higher white-cell (p = 0.045) and lymphocyte (p = 0.043) counts; but not with being symptomatic (p = 0.683). The commonest symptoms were fever (62.5\%), dry cough (48.0\%) and sore throat (26.9\%). The median duration ({IQR}) was 3.0 (1.0–5.0) and 18.0 (15.0–29.5) days, respectively before and during hospitalization. Conclusions In contrast to high-risk countries, the younger age, milder disease and low mortality observed in local patients during the initial phase of the pandemic, reflect the early success in containment of the pandemic in Sri Lanka. However, once the disease becomes severe, the factors determining disease fatality remain the same as in other countries. This highlights the value of establishing strong public health systems and disease surveillance in a country, which could provide long-term effects on disease control.},

	abstract = {Background The World Health Organization stated a pandemic by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus {SARS}-Cov2 ({COVID}-19) on March, 2020 with devastating implications for populations, healthcare systems, and economies globally. Objective The present study explores the association between patients living in municipalities with crowding conditions and poverty and mortality from {COVID}-19 in Mexico; specifically evaluating the socioeconomic characteristics of the municipality in which the patients reside and some individual characteristics. Methods In the present study, we examined public information collected from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System informing all persons tested for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and published by the Ministry of Health. The present analysis was restricted to those with the date of registration to October 12, 2021. The association between the main exposures (overcrowded conditions and poverty) and the outcomes of interest (death by {COVID}-19) was explored using Cox proportional hazard regression models, including frailty penalties to accommodate multilevel data and random effects for the municipality of case occurrence. Results A total of 9619917 subjects were included in the Epidemiological Surveillance System for viral respiratory disease platform. Of those for which results were available, 6141403 were negative for {COVID}-19 and 3478514 were positive for {COVID}-19; with a total of 273216 deaths in those who tested positive. Among those positive to {COVID}-19 mean age was 46.9. Patients living in municipalities with high rates of crowding conditions increased the risk of dying from {COVID}-19 by 8\% (95\% {CI}: 1.03, 1.14). Individuals living in municipalities with indigenous background was associated with an increased risk of dying from {COVID}-19 ({HR} = 1.10; 95\% {CI}: 1.04, 1.17). Individuals living in municipalities with illiteracy ({HR} = 1.09; 95\% {CI}: 1.03, 1.11), poverty ({HR} = 1.17; 95\% {CI}: 1.14, 1.19), food insecurity ({HR} = 1.094; 95\% {CI} 1.02, 1.06), limited access to social security ({HR} = 1.10; 95\% {CI}: 1.08, 1.13) and health services ({HR} = 1.06; 95\% {CI}: 1.04, 1.08) had a higher risk of mortality from {COVID}-19. Conclusion Our data suggest that patients living in municipalities with higher rates of crowding conditions and higher rates of poverty had elevated risk of mortality from {COVID}-19. In Mexico, the {COVID}-19 pandemic is a systemic crisis linked to human development since we have seen that it affects less developed and more vulnerable municipalities. Policies to reduce vulnerabilities and develop strategies to deal with health crises like the current one needs to be considered.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection with increasing global prevalence. It is endemic in more than 100 countries, with a heavy burden in Asia. Ultrasound findings including gallbladder wall thickening, ascites, and pleural effusions secondary to plasma leakage have been described in dengue. We aimed to determine if the presence of point-of-care ultrasound findings early in suspected dengue could predict clinical worsening in ambulatory pediatric patients.
{METHODS}: We did a prospective, single-blinded, observational cohort study at a children's hospital in Siem Reap, Cambodia during periods of dengue outbreak. Ambulatory patients were screened and children ages {\textgreater} 3 month and ≤ 16 years with suspected acute, non-severe dengue were enrolled. Subjects had chest and abdominal ultrasound exams. Independently, subjects were evaluated by a blinded physician who determined a treatment plan as per usual practice. Follow-up was conducted 7-10 days after the initial visit. Analysis of ultrasound findings was performed to determine their relationship with outcome measures including need for unplanned hospital visits or admissions.
{FINDINGS}: A total of 2,186 children were screened during periods of national dengue outbreak in Cambodia in consecutive years 2018-2019, and 253 children met eligibility criteria. Results showed patients with gallbladder wall thickening ({\textgreater} 3·0 mm) who were discharged had a significantly more likely need for unplanned visit or hospitalization than those with normal gallbladder wall, 67\% (95\% {CI} 44 - 84) versus 17\% (95\% {CI} 12 - 24), p {\textless} 0.0001. Subjects with any abnormal ultrasound finding were more likely to be directly admitted versus discharged upon initial presentation, 62·2\% (95\% {CI} 46.1 - 76.0) versus 19.5\% (95\% {CI} 14.8 - 25.4), p {\textless} 0.0001.
{INTERPRETATION}: Point-of-care ultrasound findings, particularly gallbladder wall thickening, in suspected early dengue can help predict disease progression in ambulatory patients. Ultrasound has potential to help guide management of suspected dengue patients and resource management during periods of dengue outbreak.

	abstract = {Background Dengue infections are on the rise in Sri Lanka and are spreading to all areas in the country. Here, we discuss the changes in dengue epidemiology in Sri Lanka in relation to changes in age distribution, changes in seroprevalence rates over time, and possible reasons contributing to such changes. Methods and findings Although the incidence of dengue increased 20-fold from the year 2000 to 2012 and a further 3-fold from 2012 to 2019, this increase is not reflected in a similar increase in the age-stratified seropositivity rates for dengue. For instance, the annual seroconversion rates were 0.76\% in 2013 and 0.91\% in 2017. The annual seroconversion rates in the 6 to 17 age group were 1.5\% per year in 2003, 3.9\% in 2013, and 4.1\% in 2017. In addition, although a 13-fold increase in dengue was seen in those who were {\textless}19 years of age, a 52.4-fold increase was seen in the 40- to 59-year age group. The case fatality rates ({CFRs}) have similarly changed, with 61.8\% of deaths occurring in those {\textless}19 years of age in the year 2000, while in 2012 to 2018, the highest {CFR} were seen in those who were aged 20 to 39 years. Although there has been a marked increase in the number of cases, the vector densities did not change during a 4-year period. The proportion of adult individuals experiencing a secondary dengue infection has also remained between 65\% and 75\% between the years 2004 and 2018. Conclusions A change in the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic infections can give rise to changes in the reported incidence of dengue. In order to take an appropriate policy decision in dengue control activities, it would be important to study the changes in virus serotypes, vector dispersion, and densities. Further, the contribution of the rise in metabolic diseases to an increase in the symptomatic as well as more severe infections due to dengue is explored.},

	abstract = {Delayed plasma leakage recognition could lead to improper fluid administration resulting in dengue shock syndrome, subsequently, multi-organ failure, and death. This prospective observational study was conducted in Bangkok, Thailand, between March 2018 and February 2020 to determine predictors of plasma leakage and develop a plasma leakage predictive score among dengue patients aged ≥15 years. Of 667 confirmed dengue patients, 318 (47.7\%) developed plasma leakage, and 349 (52.3\%) had no plasma leakage. Multivariate analysis showed three independent factors associated with plasma leakage, including body mass index ≥25.0 kg/m2 (odds ratio [{OR}] = 1.784; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 1.040–3.057; P = 0.035), platelet count {\textless}100,000/mm3 on fever days 3 to 4 ({OR} = 2.151; 95\% {CI} = 1.269–3.647; P = 0.004), and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase ≥100 U/l on fever days 3 to 4 ({OR} = 2.189; 95\% {CI} = 1.231–3.891; P = 0.008). Because these three parameters had evidence of equality, each independent factor was weighted to give a score of 1 with a total plasma-leak score of 3. Higher scores were associated with increased plasma leakage occurrence, with {ORs} of 2.017 (95\% {CI} = 1.052–3.869; P = 0.035) for score 1, 6.158 (95\% {CI} = 2.914–13.015; P {\textless}0.001) for score 2, and 6.300 (95\% {CI} = 2.419–16.407; P {\textless}0.001) for score 3. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curves for predicting plasma leakage was good (0.677 [95\% {CI} = 0.616–0.739]). Patients with a plasma-leak score ≥1 had high sensitivity (88.8\%), and those with a plasma-leak score of 3 had high specificity (93.4\%) for plasma leakage occurrence. This simple and easily accessible clinical score might help physicians provide early and timely appropriate clinical dengue management in endemic areas.},

	abstract = {Background Dengue causes 50 million infections per year, posing a large disease and economic burden in tropical and subtropical regions. Only a proportion of dengue cases require hospitalization, and predictive tools to triage dengue patients at greater risk of complications may optimize usage of limited healthcare resources. For severe dengue ({SD}), proposed by the World Health Organization ({WHO}) 2009 dengue guidelines, predictive tools are lacking. Methods We undertook a retrospective study of adult dengue patients in Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, from 2006 to 2008. Demographic, clinical and laboratory variables at presentation from dengue polymerase chain reaction-positive and serology-positive patients were used to predict the development of {SD} after hospitalization using generalized linear models ({GLMs}). Principal findings Predictive tools compatible with well-resourced and resource-limited settings – not requiring laboratory measurements – performed acceptably with optimism-corrected specificities of 29\% and 27\% respectively for 90\% sensitivity. Higher risk of severe dengue ({SD}) was associated with female gender, lower than normal hematocrit level, abdominal distension, vomiting and fever on admission. Lower risk of {SD} was associated with more years of age (in a cohort with an interquartile range of 27–47 years of age), leucopenia and fever duration on admission. Among the warning signs proposed by {WHO} 2009, we found support for abdominal pain or tenderness and vomiting as predictors of combined forms of {SD}. Conclusions The application of these predictive tools in the clinical setting may reduce unnecessary admissions by 19\% allowing the allocation of scarce public health resources to patients according to the severity of outcomes.},

{OBJECTIVES}: To describe severe manifestations of dengue in Vietnamese adults and to identify early indicators of these manifestations.
{STUDY} {DESIGN}: A prospective longitudinal study was carried out from July to October, 2007, in People's Hospital 115, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
{RESULTS}: One hundred ninety-five clinically suspected dengue patients were enrolled. 151 of these were laboratory-confirmed using serum samples on day 3 after onset of fever for {RT}-{PCR} and/or virus isolation. Dengue was associated with plasma leakage in 51 patients (33.8\%), gallbladder thickening in 30 patients (20\%), spontaneous bleeding in 127 patients (84.1\%), and internal bleeding in 37 patients (24.5\%). Several early indicators were associated with severe manifestations of dengue. Frequent vomiting ({\textgreater} or =3 times a day), marked lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes on day 3 after onset of fever were significantly associated with plasma leakage and gallbladder thickening. Increased alanine aminotransferase level in plasma on day 3 was significantly associated with internal bleeding. Gallbladder thickening and internal bleeding were more common with specific serotypes.
{CONCLUSION}: Several severe manifestations of dengue were observed in Vietnamese adults. These manifestations were associated with early clinical and biological indicators. This information may be useful for clinicians to better monitor adult dengue patients, particularly in tropical areas where health resources may be limited.},

	abstract = {Background: Dengue is an endemic disease for Bangladesh with occasional outbreak. Little is known about the predictors of severe dengue.
Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted in the medicine department of Dhaka Medical College from April 2019 to March 2020. Total 199 consecutive patients were enrolled in this study. For the purpose of the analysis, dengue fever was classified as group I and dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome was classified as group {II}.
Results: The mean ({SD}) age of the study population was 28.5(12.1) and 87.4\% were less than 40 years of age. The male and female ratio was about 3:1. Among the total study population, 149(74.9\%) patients had {DF}, 46 (23.1\%) had {DHF} and only 4 (2\%) had {DSS} on presentation. Baseline demography and clinical presentation did not significantly differ between classical dengue and severe dengue. Previous history of dengue had low association with severity ({RR}, 95\%{CI}, phi, P value; 1.2, 1.04-1.40, 0.25, 0.001).Most of the laboratory parameters were similar between the groups. The number of platelet count was significantly lower in {DHF} and {DSS} [median ({IQR}) 43500(16500-95250], than {DF} [median ({IQR}) 65000(33000-1170000, p-value 0.01]
Conclusion: Previous infection with dengue virus and decreasing platelet count are the predictors of the severe dengue.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In 2009, the World Health Organization ({WHO}) proposed seven warning signs ({WS}) as criteria for hospitalization and predictors of severe dengue ({SD}). We assessed their performance for predicting dengue hemorrhagic fever ({DHF}) and {SD} in adult dengue.
{METHOD}: {DHF}, {WS} and {SD} were defined according to the {WHO} 1997 and 2009 dengue guidelines. We analyzed the prevalence, sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value ({PPV}) and negative predictive value ({NPV}) of {WS} before {DHF} and {SD} onset.
{RESULTS}: Of 1507 cases, median age was 35 years (5(th)-95(th) percentile, 17-60), illness duration on admission 4 days (5(th)-95(th) percentile, 2-6) and length of hospitalization 5 days (5(th)-95(th) percentile, 3-7). {DHF} occurred in 298 (19.5\%) and {SD} in 248 (16.5\%). Of these, {WS} occurred before {DHF} in 124 and {SD} in 65 at median of two days before {DHF} or {SD}. Three commonest warning signs were lethargy, abdominal pain/tenderness and mucosal bleeding. No single {WS} alone or combined had Sn {\textgreater}64\% in predicting severe disease. Specificity was {\textgreater}90\% for both {DHF} and {SD} with persistent vomiting, hepatomegaly, hematocrit rise and rapid platelet drop, clinical fluid accumulation, and any 3 or 4 {WS}. Any one of seven {WS} had 96\% Sn but only 18\% Sp for {SD}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: No {WS} was highly sensitive in predicting subsequent {DHF} or {SD} in our confirmed adult dengue cohort. Persistent vomiting, hepatomegaly, hematocrit rise and rapid platelet drop, and clinical fluid accumulation, as well as any 3 or 4 {WS} were highly specific for {DHF} or {SD}.},

The present study investigated the association of blood groups with severity of {DENV} infection in the northern region of Sri Lanka. The blood-groups of 405 patients positive for {DENV} {NS}1 antigen and anti-{DENV} {IgM}/{IgG} were determined using the standard haemagglutination assay recommended by the national blood bank/s. The occurrence of severe dengue in patients with certain blood groups was significantly different (p {\textless} 0.001) to those with other blood groups. Patients with {AB} blood group had more than 2.5 times higher risk of developing {DHF} than those with other blood groups. On the other hand, patients with blood group O were significantly under represented for {DHF} relative to the proportion of this blood group in the general population. Thus dengue patients with blood group O appear to have a low risk of developing {DHF} than those with other blood groups.},

The underlying technology is key to further innovations and, despite critical views and even bans within communities and regions, large language models are here to stay. This commentary presents the potential benefits and challenges of educational applications of large language models, from student and teacher perspectives. We briefly discuss the current state of large language models and their applications. We then highlight how these models can be used to create educational content, improve student engagement and interaction, and personalize learning experiences. With regard to challenges, we argue that large language models in education require teachers and learners to develop sets of competencies and literacies necessary to both understand the technology as well as their limitations and unexpected brittleness of such systems. In addition, a clear strategy within educational systems and a clear pedagogical approach with a strong focus on critical thinking and strategies for fact checking are required to integrate and take full advantage of large language models in learning settings and teaching curricula. Other challenges such as the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous human oversight, and the potential for misuse are not unique to the application of {AI} in education. But we believe that, if handled sensibly, these challenges can offer insights and opportunities in education scenarios to acquaint students early on with potential societal biases, criticalities, and risks of {AI} applications. We conclude with recommendations for how to address these challenges and ensure that such models are used in a responsible and ethical manner in education.},

The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales.

This paper tackles the problem of better utilizing {GPUs} for this task. While {GPUs} excel at data-parallel tasks, prior approaches are bottlenecked by algorithms that expose less parallelism, such as k-min selection, or make poor use of the memory hierarchy. We propose a design for k-selection that operates at up to 55\% of theoretical peak performance, enabling a nearest neighbor implementation that is 8.5x faster than prior {GPU} state of the art. We apply it in different similarity search scenarios, by proposing optimized design for brute-force, approximate and compressed-domain search based on product quantization. In all these setups, we outperform the state of the art by large margins. Our implementation enables the construction of a high accuracy k-{NN} graph on 95 million images from the Yfcc100M dataset in 35 minutes, and of a graph connecting 1 billion vectors in less than 12 hours on 4 Maxwell Titan X {GPUs}.

	abstract = {Recent advances in generative pre-trained transformer large language models have emphasised the potential risks of unfair use of artificial intelligence ({AI}) generated content in an academic environment and intensified efforts in searching for solutions to detect such content. The paper examines the general functionality of detection tools for artificial intelligence generated text and evaluates them based on accuracy and error type analysis. Specifically, the study seeks to answer research questions about whether existing detection tools can reliably differentiate between human-written text and {ChatGPT}-generated text, and whether machine translation and content obfuscation techniques affect the detection of {AI}-generated text. The research covers 12 publicly available tools and two commercial systems (Turnitin and {PlagiarismCheck}) that are widely used in the academic setting. The researchers conclude that the available detection tools are neither accurate nor reliable and have a main bias towards classifying the output as human-written rather than detecting {AI}-generated text. Furthermore, content obfuscation techniques significantly worsen the performance of tools. The study makes several significant contributions. First, it summarises up-to-date similar scientific and non-scientific efforts in the field. Second, it presents the result of one of the most comprehensive tests conducted so far, based on a rigorous research methodology, an original document set, and a broad coverage of tools. Third, it discusses the implications and drawbacks of using detection tools for {AI}-generated text in academic settings.},

	abstract = {Traditional explanatory resources, such as user manuals and textbooks, often contain content that may not cater to the diverse backgrounds and information needs of users. Yet, developing intuitive, user-centered methods to effectively explain complex or large amounts of information is still an open research challenge. In this paper we present {ExplanatoryGPT}, an approach we devised and implemented to transform textual documents into interactive, intelligent resources, capable of offering dynamic, personalized explanations. Our approach uses state-of-the-art question-answering technology to generate on-demand, expandable explanations, with the aim of allowing readers to efficiently navigate and comprehend static materials. {ExplanatoryGPT} integrates {ChatGPT}, a state-of-the-art language model, with Achinstein’s philosophical theory of explanations. By combining question generation and answer retrieval algorithms with {ChatGPT}, our method generates interactive, user-centered explanations, while mitigating common issues associated with {ChatGPT}, such as hallucinations and memory shortcomings. To showcase the effectiveness of our Explanatory {AI}, we conducted tests using a variety of sources, including a legal textbook and documentation of some health and financial software. Specifically, we provide several examples that illustrate how {ExplanatoryGPT} excels over {ChatGPT} in generating more precise explanations, accomplished through thoughtful macro-planning of explanation content. Notably, our approach also avoids the need to provide the entire context of the explanation as a prompt to {ChatGPT}, a process that is often not feasible due to common memory constraints.},

As one of the most advanced artificial intelligence applications, {ChatGPT} has drawn much public attention across the globe. In this regard, this study examines {ChatGPT} in education, among early adopters, through a qualitative instrumental case study. Conducted in three stages, the first stage of the study reveals that the public discourse in social media is generally positive and there is enthusiasm regarding its use in educational settings. However, there are also voices who are approaching cautiously using {ChatGPT} in educational settings. The second stage of the study examines the case of {ChatGPT} through lenses of educational transformation, response quality, usefulness, personality and emotion, and ethics. In the third and final stage of the study, the investigation of user experiences through ten educational scenarios revealed various issues, including cheating, honesty and truthfulness of {ChatGPT}, privacy misleading, and manipulation. The findings of this study provide several research directions that should be considered to ensure a safe and responsible adoption of chatbots, specifically {ChatGPT}, in education.},

This study explores the potential opportunities and threats that {ChatGPT} poses to overall education from the perspective of students and educators. Furthermore, for programming learning, we explore how {ChatGPT} helps students improve their programming skills. To demonstrate this, we conducted different coding-related experiments with {ChatGPT}, including code generation from problem descriptions, pseudocode generation of algorithms from texts, and code correction. The generated codes are validated with an online judge system to evaluate their accuracy. In addition, we conducted several surveys with students and teachers to find out how {ChatGPT} supports programming learning and teaching. Finally, we present the survey results and analysis.},

	abstract = {Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream {NLP} tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation ({RAG}) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce {RAG} models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two {RAG} formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive {NLP} tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain {QA} tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that {RAG} models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

	abstract = {Despite the remarkable ability of large language models ({LMs}) to comprehend and generate language, they have a tendency to hallucinate and create factually inaccurate output. Augmenting {LMs} by retrieving information from external knowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing retrieval-augmented {LMs} employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout the generation process is essential. There have been some past efforts to retrieve information multiple times while generating outputs, which mostly retrieve documents at fixed intervals using the previous context as queries. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active {REtrieval} augmented generation ({FLARE}), a generic retrieval-augmented generation method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test {FLARE} along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets. {FLARE} achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

We analyze language model performance on two tasks that require identifying relevant information within their input contexts: multi-document question answering and key-value retrieval. We find that performance is often highest when relevant information occurs at the beginning or end of the input context, and significantly degrades when models must access relevant information in the middle of long contexts. Furthermore, performance substantially decreases as the input context grows longer, even for explicitly long-context models. Our analysis provides a better understanding of how language models use their input context and provides new evaluation protocols for future long-context models.},

This paper tackles the problem of better utilizing {GPUs} for this task.

We propose a design for k-selection that operates at up to 55\% of theoretical peak performance, enabling a nearest neighbor implementation that is 8.5x faster than prior {GPU} state of the art. We apply it in different similarity search scenarios, by proposing optimized design for brute-force, approximate and compressed-domain search based on product quantization. In all these setups, we outperform the state of the art by large margins. Our implementation enables the construction of a high accuracy k-{NN} graph on 95 million images from the Yfcc100M dataset in 35 minutes, and of a graph connecting 1 billion vectors in less than 12 hours on 4 Maxwell Titan X {GPUs}.

Today, attempts to assess models' clinical knowledge typically rely on automated evaluations on limited benchmarks. There is no standard to evaluate model predictions and reasoning across a breadth of tasks. To address this, we present {MultiMedQA}, a benchmark combining six existing open question answering datasets spanning professional medical exams, research, and consumer queries; and {HealthSearchQA}, a new free-response dataset of medical questions searched online. We propose a framework for human evaluation of model answers along multiple axes including factuality, precision, possible harm, and bias. In addition, we evaluate {PaLM} (a 540-billion parameter {LLM}) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-{PaLM}, on {MultiMedQA}. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-{PaLM} achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every {MultiMedQA} multiple-choice dataset ({MedQA}, {MedMCQA}, {PubMedQA}, {MMLU} clinical topics), including 67.6\% accuracy on {MedQA} ({US} Medical License Exam questions), surpassing prior state-of-the-art by over 17\%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps in Flan-{PaLM} responses. To resolve this we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning {LLMs} to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-{PaLM}, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, recall of knowledge, and medical reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of {LLMs} in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal important limitations of today's models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful {LLM} models for clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Although large language models ({LLMs}) often produce impressive outputs, it remains unclear how they perform in real-world scenarios requiring strong reasoning skills and expert domain knowledge. We set out to investigate whether {GPT}-3.5 (Codex and {InstructGPT}) can be applied to answer and reason about difficult real-world-based questions. We utilize two multiple-choice medical exam questions ({USMLE} and {MedMCQA}) and a medical reading comprehension dataset ({PubMedQA}). We investigate multiple prompting scenarios: Chain-of-Thought ({CoT}, think step-by-step), zero- and few-shot (prepending the question with question-answer exemplars) and retrieval augmentation (injecting Wikipedia passages into the prompt). For a subset of the {USMLE} questions, a medical expert reviewed and annotated the model's {CoT}. We found that {InstructGPT} can often read, reason and recall expert knowledge. Failure are primarily due to lack of knowledge and reasoning errors and trivial guessing heuristics are observed, e.g.{\textbackslash} too often predicting labels A and D on {USMLE}. Sampling and combining many completions overcome some of these limitations. Using 100 samples, Codex 5-shot {CoT} not only gives close to well-calibrated predictive probability but also achieves human-level performances on the three datasets. {USMLE}: 60.2\%, {MedMCQA}: 62.7\% and {PubMedQA}: 78.2\%.},

	title = {Capabilities of {GPT}-4 on Medical Challenge Problems},
	abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation across various domains, including medicine. We present a comprehensive evaluation of {GPT}-4 [Ope23], a state-of-the-art {LLM}, on medical competency examinations and benchmark datasets. {GPT}-4 is a general-purpose model that is not specialized for medical problems through training or engineered to solve clinical tasks. Our analysis covers two sets of official practice materials for the United States Medical Licensing Examination ({USMLE}), a three-step examination program used to assess clinical competency and grant licensure in the United States. We also evaluate performance on the {MultiMedQA} suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of test questions containing both text and images on model performance, probe for memorization of content during training, and study calibration of the probabilities, which is of critical importance in high-stakes applications like medicine. Our results show that {GPT}-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on {USMLE} by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models ({GPT}-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-{PaLM}, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-{PaLM} 540B). In addition, {GPT}-4 is significantly better calibrated than {GPT}-3.5, demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the behavior of the model qualitatively by presenting a case study that shows the ability of {GPT}-4 to explain medical reasoning, personalize explanations to students, and interactively craft new counterfactual scenarios around a medical case. Implications of the findings are discussed for potential uses of {GPT}-4 in medical education, assessment, and clinical practice, with appropriate attention to challenges of accuracy and safety.},

	abstract = {{AI} is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., {BERT}, {DALL}-E, {GPT}-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.},

	abstract = {Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model {PaLM}. We trained {PaLM} on 6144 {TPU} v4 chips using Pathways, a new {ML} system which enables highly efficient training across multiple {TPU} Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, {PaLM} 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released {BIG}-bench benchmark. A significant number of {BIG}-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. {PaLM} also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2005.14165},
	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many {NLP} tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current {NLP} systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train {GPT}-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, {GPT}-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. {GPT}-3 achieves strong performance on many {NLP} datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where {GPT}-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where {GPT}-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that {GPT}-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of {GPT}-3 in general.},

We find that while most recent models have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest {GPT}-3 model improves over random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every one of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before they can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance and frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-random accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law. By comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model's academic and professional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many tasks and to identify important shortcomings.},

Galactica also performs well on reasoning, outperforming Chinchilla on mathematical {MMLU} by 41.3\% to 35.7\%, and {PaLM} 540B on {MATH} with a score of 20.4\% versus 8.8\%. It also sets a new state-of-the-art on downstream tasks such as {PubMedQA} and {MedMCQA} dev of 77.6\% and 52.9\%. And despite not being trained on a general corpus, Galactica outperforms {BLOOM} and {OPT}-175B on {BIG}-bench. We believe these results demonstrate the potential for language models as a new interface for science. We open source the model for the benefit of the scientific community.},

	abstract = {Generative Large Language Models ({LLMs}) such as {GPT}-3 are capable of generating highly fluent responses to a wide variety of user prompts. However, {LLMs} are known to hallucinate facts and make non-factual statements which can undermine trust in their output. Existing fact-checking approaches either require access to the output probability distribution (which may not be available for systems such as {ChatGPT}) or external databases that are interfaced via separate, often complex, modules. In this work, we propose "{SelfCheckGPT}", a simple sampling-based approach that can be used to fact-check black-box models in a zero-resource fashion, i.e. without an external database. {SelfCheckGPT} leverages the simple idea that if a {LLM} has knowledge of a given concept, sampled responses are likely to be similar and contain consistent facts. However, for hallucinated facts, stochastically sampled responses are likely to diverge and contradict one another. We investigate this approach by using {GPT}-3 to generate passages about individuals from the {WikiBio} dataset, and manually annotate the factuality of the generated passages. We demonstrate that {SelfCheckGPT} can: i) detect non-factual and factual sentences; and ii) rank passages in terms of factuality. We compare our approach to several baselines and show that in sentence hallucination detection, our approach has {AUC}-{PR} scores comparable to or better than grey-box methods, while {SelfCheckGPT} is best at passage factuality assessment.},

	abstract = {Recently, various neural encoder-decoder models pioneered by Seq2Seq framework have been proposed to achieve the goal of generating more abstractive summaries by learning to map input text to output text. At a high level, such neural models can freely generate summaries without any constraint on the words or phrases used. Moreover, their format is closer to human-edited summaries and output is more readable and fluent. However, the neural model's abstraction ability is a double-edged sword. A commonly observed problem with the generated summaries is the distortion or fabrication of factual information in the article. This inconsistency between the original text and the summary has caused various concerns over its applicability, and the previous evaluation methods of text summarization are not suitable for this issue. In response to the above problems, the current research direction is predominantly divided into two categories, one is to design fact-aware evaluation metrics to select outputs without factual inconsistency errors, and the other is to develop new summarization systems towards factual consistency. In this survey, we focus on presenting a comprehensive review of these fact-specific evaluation methods and text summarization models.},

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation ({RAG}) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce {RAG} models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two {RAG} formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive {NLP} tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain {QA} tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that {RAG} models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

	abstract = {Pretraining large neural language models, such as {BERT}, has led to impressive gains on many natural language processing ({NLP}) tasks. However, most pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web. A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by starting from general-domain language models. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical {NLP} benchmark from publicly-available datasets. Our experiments show that domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of biomedical {NLP} tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board. Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common practices are unnecessary with {BERT} models, such as using complex tagging schemes in named entity recognition ({NER}). To help accelerate research in biomedical {NLP}, we have released our state-of-the-art pretrained and task-specific models for the community, and created a leaderboard featuring our {BLURB} benchmark (short for Biomedical Language Understanding \& Reasoning Benchmark) at https://aka.ms/{BLURB}.},

In this work, we present Data Augmented Relation Extraction({DARE}), a simple method to augment training data by properly fine-tuning {GPT}-2 to generate examples for specific relation types. The generated training data is then used in combination with the gold dataset to train a {BERT}-based {RE} classifier. In a series of experiments we show the advantages of our method, which leads in improvements of up to 11 F1 score points against a strong base-line. Also, {DARE} achieves new state of the art in three widely used biomedical {RE} datasets surpassing the previous best results by 4.7 F1 points on average.},

It has also been demonstrated that the downstream task performance of such models can be improved by pretraining larger models for longer on more data. In this work, we empirically evaluate the extent to which these results extend to tasks in science. We use 14 domain-specific transformer-based models (including {ScholarBERT}, a new 770M-parameter science-focused masked language model pretrained on up to 225B tokens) to evaluate the impact of training data, model size, pretraining and finetuning time on 12 downstream scientific tasks. Interestingly, we find that increasing model sizes, training data, or compute time does not always lead to significant improvements (i.e., {\textgreater}1\% F1), if at all, in scientific information extraction tasks and offered possible explanations for the surprising performance differences.},

	abstract = {Recent artificial intelligence ({AI}) systems have reached milestones in "grand challenges" ranging from Go to protein-folding. The capability to retrieve medical knowledge, reason over it, and answer medical questions comparably to physicians has long been viewed as one such grand challenge. Large language models ({LLMs}) have catalyzed significant progress in medical question answering; Med-{PaLM} was the first model to exceed a "passing" score in {US} Medical Licensing Examination ({USMLE}) style questions with a score of 67.2\% on the {MedQA} dataset. However, this and other prior work suggested significant room for improvement, especially when models' answers were compared to clinicians' answers. Here we present Med-{PaLM} 2, which bridges these gaps by leveraging a combination of base {LLM} improvements ({PaLM} 2), medical domain finetuning, and prompting strategies including a novel ensemble refinement approach. Med-{PaLM} 2 scored up to 86.5\% on the {MedQA} dataset, improving upon Med-{PaLM} by over 19\% and setting a new state-of-the-art. We also observed performance approaching or exceeding state-of-the-art across {MedMCQA}, {PubMedQA}, and {MMLU} clinical topics datasets. We performed detailed human evaluations on long-form questions along multiple axes relevant to clinical applications. In pairwise comparative ranking of 1066 consumer medical questions, physicians preferred Med-{PaLM} 2 answers to those produced by physicians on eight of nine axes pertaining to clinical utility (p {\textless} 0.001). We also observed significant improvements compared to Med-{PaLM} on every evaluation axis (p {\textless} 0.001) on newly introduced datasets of 240 long-form "adversarial" questions to probe {LLM} limitations. While further studies are necessary to validate the efficacy of these models in real-world settings, these results highlight rapid progress towards physician-level performance in medical question answering.},

	abstract = {Although large language models ({LLMs}) often produce impressive outputs, it remains unclear how they perform in real-world scenarios requiring strong reasoning skills and expert domain knowledge. We set out to investigate whether {GPT}-3.5 (Codex and {InstructGPT}) can be applied to answer and reason about difficult real-world-based questions. We utilize two multiple-choice medical exam questions ({USMLE} and {MedMCQA}) and a medical reading comprehension dataset ({PubMedQA}). We investigate multiple prompting scenarios: Chain-of-Thought ({CoT}, think step-by-step), zero- and few-shot (prepending the question with question-answer exemplars) and retrieval augmentation (injecting Wikipedia passages into the prompt). For a subset of the {USMLE} questions, a medical expert reviewed and annotated the model's {CoT}. We found that {InstructGPT} can often read, reason and recall expert knowledge. Failure are primarily due to lack of knowledge and reasoning errors and trivial guessing heuristics are observed, e.g.{\textbackslash} too often predicting labels A and D on {USMLE}. Sampling and combining many completions overcome some of these limitations. Using 100 samples, Codex 5-shot {CoT} not only gives close to well-calibrated predictive probability but also achieves human-level performances on the three datasets. {USMLE}: 60.2\%, {MedMCQA}: 62.7\% and {PubMedQA}: 78.2\%.},

The explosive growth in scientific literature and data has made it ever harder to discover useful insights in a large mass of information.

In this paper we introduce Galactica: a large language model that can store, combine and reason about scientific knowledge. We train on a large scientific corpus of papers, reference material, knowledge bases and many other sources. We outperform existing models on a range of scientific tasks. On technical knowledge probes such as {LaTeX} equations, Galactica outperforms the latest {GPT}-3 by 68.2\% versus 49.0\%. Galactica also performs well on reasoning, outperforming Chinchilla on mathematical {MMLU} by 41.3\% to 35.7\%, and {PaLM} 540B on {MATH} with a score of 20.4\% versus 8.8\%. It also sets a new state-of-the-art on downstream tasks such as {PubMedQA} and {MedMCQA} dev of 77.6\% and 52.9\%. And despite not being trained on a general corpus, Galactica outperforms {BLOOM} and {OPT}-175B on {BIG}-bench.

To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x' that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x, from which the final output y can be derived.

Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.

Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

We implement both rule-based and popular neural methods by sequentially combining a document retriever and a machine comprehension model.

	abstract = {We study whether language models can evaluate the validity of their own claims and predict which questions they will be able to answer correctly. We first show that larger models are well-calibrated on diverse multiple choice and true/false questions when they are provided in the right format. Thus we can approach self-evaluation on open-ended sampling tasks by asking models to first propose answers, and then to evaluate the probability "P(True)" that their answers are correct. We find encouraging performance, calibration, and scaling for P(True) on a diverse array of tasks. Performance at self-evaluation further improves when we allow models to consider many of their own samples before predicting the validity of one specific possibility. Next, we investigate whether models can be trained to predict "P({IK})", the probability that "I know" the answer to a question, without reference to any particular proposed answer. Models perform well at predicting P({IK}) and partially generalize across tasks, though they struggle with calibration of P({IK}) on new tasks. The predicted P({IK}) probabilities also increase appropriately in the presence of relevant source materials in the context, and in the presence of hints towards the solution of mathematical word problems. We hope these observations lay the groundwork for training more honest models, and for investigating how honesty generalizes to cases where models are trained on objectives other than the imitation of human writing.},

We find that while most recent models have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest {GPT}-3 model improves over random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every one of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before they can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance and frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-random accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law. By comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model's academic and professional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many tasks and to identify important shortcomings.},

We trained {PaLM} on 6144 {TPU} v4 chips using Pathways, a new {ML} system which enables highly efficient training across multiple {TPU} Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, {PaLM} 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released {BIG}-bench benchmark. A significant number of {BIG}-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. {PaLM} also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale.

In this paper, we propose a new decoding strategy, self-consistency, to replace the naive greedy decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting. It first samples a diverse set of reasoning paths instead of only taking the greedy one, and then selects the most consistent answer by marginalizing out the sampled reasoning paths. Self-consistency leverages the intuition that a complex reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of thinking leading to its unique correct answer. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that self-consistency boosts the performance of chain-of-thought prompting with a striking margin on a range of popular arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, including {GSM}8K (+17.9\%), {SVAMP} (+11.0\%), {AQuA} (+12.2\%), {StrategyQA} (+6.4\%) and {ARC}-challenge (+3.9\%).},

	abstract = {Like humans, large language models ({LLMs}) do not always generate the best output on their first try. Motivated by how humans refine their written text, we introduce Self-Refine, an approach for improving initial outputs from {LLMs} through iterative feedback and refinement. The main idea is to generate an initial output using an {LLMs}; then, the same {LLMs} provides feedback for its output and uses it to refine itself, iteratively. Self-Refine does not require any supervised training data, additional training, or reinforcement learning, and instead uses a single {LLM} as the generator, refiner, and feedback provider. We evaluate Self-Refine across 7 diverse tasks, ranging from dialog response generation to mathematical reasoning, using state-of-the-art ({GPT}-3.5, {ChatGPT}, and {GPT}-4) {LLMs}. Across all evaluated tasks, outputs generated with Self-Refine are preferred by humans and automatic metrics over those generated with the same {LLM} using conventional one-step generation, improving by {\textasciitilde}20\% absolute on average in task performance.

We present a comprehensive evaluation of {GPT}-4, a state-of-the-art {LLM}, on medical competency examinations and benchmark datasets. {GPT}-4 is a general-purpose model that is not specialized for medical problems through training or engineered to solve clinical tasks. Our analysis covers two sets of official practice materials for the {USMLE}, a three-step examination program used to assess clinical competency and grant licensure in the United States. We also evaluate performance on the {MultiMedQA} suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of test questions containing both text and images on model performance, probe for memorization of content during training, and study probability calibration, which is of critical importance in high-stakes applications like medicine. Our results show that {GPT}-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on {USMLE} by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models ({GPT}-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-{PaLM}, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-{PaLM} 540B). In addition, {GPT}-4 is significantly better calibrated than {GPT}-3.5, demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the behavior of the model qualitatively through a case study that shows the ability of {GPT}-4 to explain medical reasoning, personalize explanations to students, and interactively craft new counterfactual scenarios around a medical case. Implications of the findings are discussed for potential uses of {GPT}-4 in medical education, assessment, and clinical practice, with appropriate attention to challenges of accuracy and safety.},

	abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) have demonstrated human-level performance on a vast spectrum of natural language tasks. However, it is largely unexplored whether they can better internalize knowledge from a structured data, such as a knowledge graph, or from text. In this work, we propose a method to infuse structured knowledge into {LLMs}, by directly training T5 models on factual triples of knowledge graphs ({KGs}). We show that models pre-trained on Wikidata {KG} with our method outperform the T5 baselines on {FreebaseQA} and {WikiHop}, as well as the Wikidata-answerable subset of {TriviaQA} and {NaturalQuestions}. The models pre-trained on factual triples compare competitively with the ones on natural language sentences that contain the same knowledge. Trained on a smaller size {KG}, {WikiMovies}, we saw 3x improvement of exact match score on {MetaQA} task. The proposed method has an advantage that no alignment between the knowledge graph and text corpus is required in curating training data. This makes our method particularly useful when working with industry-scale knowledge graphs.},

	abstract = {Past research has demonstrated that large neural language models ({LMs}) encode surprising amounts of factual information: however, augmenting or modifying this information requires modifying a corpus and retraining, which is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we develop a neural {LM} that includes an interpretable neuro-symbolic {KB} in the form of a “fact memory”. Each element of the fact memory is formed from a triple of vectors, where each vector corresponds to a {KB} entity or relation. Our {LM} improves performance on knowledge-intensive question-answering tasks, sometimes dramatically, including a 27 point increase in one setting of {WebQuestionsSP} over a state-of-the-art open-book model, despite using 5\% of the parameters. Most interestingly, we demonstrate that the model can be modified, without any re-training, by updating the fact memory.},

However, so far they have been evaluated primarily on benchmarks where all information in the input context is relevant for solving the task. In this work, we investigate the distractibility of large language models, i.e., how the model problem-solving accuracy can be influenced by irrelevant context. In particular, we introduce Grade-School Math with Irrelevant Context ({GSM}-{IC}), an arithmetic reasoning dataset with irrelevant information in the problem description. We use this benchmark to measure the distractibility of cutting-edge prompting techniques for large language models, and find that the model performance is dramatically decreased when irrelevant information is included. We also identify several approaches for mitigating this deficiency, such as decoding with self-consistency and adding to the prompt an instruction that tells the language model to ignore the irrelevant information.},

	abstract = {Language models ({LMs}) are becoming the foundation for almost all major language technologies, but their capabilities, limitations, and risks are not well understood. We present Holistic Evaluation of Language Models ({HELM}) to improve the transparency of language models. First, we taxonomize the vast space of potential scenarios (i.e. use cases) and metrics (i.e. desiderata) that are of interest for {LMs}. Then we select a broad subset based on coverage and feasibility, noting what's missing or underrepresented (e.g. question answering for neglected English dialects, metrics for trustworthiness). Second, we adopt a multi-metric approach: We measure 7 metrics (accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency) for each of 16 core scenarios when possible (87.5\% of the time). This ensures metrics beyond accuracy don't fall to the wayside, and that trade-offs are clearly exposed. We also perform 7 targeted evaluations, based on 26 targeted scenarios, to analyze specific aspects (e.g. reasoning, disinformation). Third, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of 30 prominent language models (spanning open, limited-access, and closed models) on all 42 scenarios, 21 of which were not previously used in mainstream {LM} evaluation. Prior to {HELM}, models on average were evaluated on just 17.9\% of the core {HELM} scenarios, with some prominent models not sharing a single scenario in common. We improve this to 96.0\%: now all 30 models have been densely benchmarked on the same core scenarios and metrics under standardized conditions. Our evaluation surfaces 25 top-level findings. For full transparency, we release all raw model prompts and completions publicly for further analysis, as well as a general modular toolkit. We intend for {HELM} to be a living benchmark for the community, continuously updated with new scenarios, metrics, and models.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence ({AI}) researchers have been developing and refining large language models ({LLMs}) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by {OpenAI}, {GPT}-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of {GPT}-4, when it was still in active development by {OpenAI}. We contend that (this early version of) {GPT}-4 is part of a new cohort of {LLMs} (along with {ChatGPT} and Google's {PaLM} for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous {AI} models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, {GPT}-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, {GPT}-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as {ChatGPT}. Given the breadth and depth of {GPT}-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence ({AGI}) system. In our exploration of {GPT}-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of {AGI}, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

Approaches to defining the concept of Artificial General Intelligence ({AGI}) are reviewed including mathematical formalisms, engineering, and biology inspired perspectives. The spectrum of designs for {AGI} systems includes systems with symbolic, emergentist, hybrid and universalist characteristics. Metrics for general intelligence are evaluated, with a conclusion that, although metrics for assessing the achievement of human-level {AGI} may be relatively straightforward (e.g. the Turing Test, or a robot that can graduate from elementary school or university), metrics for assessing partial progress remain more controversial and problematic.},

However, existing methods such as {BERT} model a single document, and do not capture dependencies or knowledge that span across documents. In this work, we propose {LinkBERT}, an {LM} pretraining method that leverages links between documents, e.g., hyperlinks. Given a text corpus, we view it as a graph of documents and create {LM} inputs by placing linked documents in the same context. We then pretrain the {LM} with two joint self-supervised objectives: masked language modeling and our new proposal, document relation prediction. We show that {LinkBERT} outperforms {BERT} on various downstream tasks across two domains: the general domain (pretrained on Wikipedia with hyperlinks) and biomedical domain (pretrained on {PubMed} with citation links). {LinkBERT} is especially effective for multi-hop reasoning and few-shot {QA} (+5\% absolute improvement on {HotpotQA} and {TriviaQA}), and our biomedical {LinkBERT} sets new states of the art on various {BioNLP} tasks (+7\% on {BioASQ} and {USMLE}).

For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users.

Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the {OpenAI} {API}, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune {GPT}-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models {InstructGPT}. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter {InstructGPT} model are preferred to outputs from the 175B {GPT}-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, {InstructGPT} models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public {NLP} datasets. Even though {InstructGPT} still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.},

	abstract = {An artificial intelligence ({AI})-based conversational large language model ({LLM}) was launched in November 2022 namely, “{ChatGPT}”. Despite the wide array of potential applications of {LLMs} in healthcare education, research and practice, several valid concerns were raised. The current systematic review aimed to investigate the possible utility of {ChatGPT} and to highlight its limitations in healthcare education, research and practice. Using the {PRIMSA} guidelines, a systematic search was conducted to retrieve English records in {PubMed}/{MEDLINE} and Google Scholar under the term “{ChatGPT}”. Eligibility criteria included the published research or preprints of any type that discussed {ChatGPT} in the context of healthcare education, research and practice. A total of 280 records were identified, and following full screening, a total of 60 records were eligible for inclusion. Benefits/applications of {ChatGPT} were cited in 51/60 (85.0\%) records with the most common being the utility in scientific writing followed by benefits in healthcare research (efficient analysis of massive datasets, code generation and rapid concise literature reviews besides utility in drug discovery and development). Benefits in healthcare practice included cost saving, documentation, personalized medicine and improved health literacy. Concerns/possible risks of {ChatGPT} use were expressed in 58/60 (96.7\%) records with the most common being the ethical issues including the risk of bias, plagiarism, copyright issues, transparency issues, legal issues, lack of originality, incorrect responses, limited knowledge, and inaccurate citations. Despite the promising applications of {ChatGPT} which can result in paradigm shifts in healthcare education, research and practice, the embrace of this application should be done with extreme caution. Specific applications of {ChatGPT} in health education include the promising utility in personalized learning tools and shift towards more focus on critical thinking and problem-based learning. In healthcare practice, {ChatGPT} can be valuable for streamlining the workflow and refining personalized medicine. Saving time for the focus on experimental design and enhancing research equity and versatility are the benefits in scientific research. Regarding authorship in scientific articles, as it currently stands, {ChatGPT} does not qualify to be listed as an author unless the {ICMJE}/{COPE} guidelines are revised and amended. An initiative involving all stakeholders involved in healthcare education, research and practice is urgently needed to set a code of ethics and conduct on the responsible practices involving {ChatGPT} among other {LLMs}.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence ({AI}) systems to process and interpret electronic health records ({EHRs}). Natural language processing ({NLP}) powered by pretrained language models is the key technology for medical {AI} systems utilizing clinical narratives. However, there are few clinical language models, the largest of which trained in the clinical domain is comparatively small at 110 million parameters (compared with billions of parameters in the general domain). It is not clear how large clinical language models with billions of parameters can help medical {AI} systems utilize unstructured {EHRs}. In this study, we develop from scratch a large clinical language model - {GatorTron} - using {\textgreater}90 billion words of text (including {\textgreater}82 billion words of de-identified clinical text) and systematically evaluate it on 5 clinical {NLP} tasks including clinical concept extraction, medical relation extraction, semantic textual similarity, natural language inference ({NLI}), and medical question answering ({MQA}). We examine how (1) scaling up the number of parameters and (2) scaling up the size of the training data could benefit these {NLP} tasks. {GatorTron} models scale up the clinical language model from 110 million to 8.9 billion parameters and improve 5 clinical {NLP} tasks (e.g., 9.6\% and 9.5\% improvement in accuracy for {NLI} and {MQA}), which can be applied to medical {AI} systems to improve healthcare delivery.

particular, toward the goal of human-like artificial general intelligence. It is sometimes
claimed, though, that machine learning is “just statistics,” hence that, in this grander
ambition, progress in {AI} is illusory. Here I take the contrary view that {LLMs} have a great
deal to teach us about the nature of language, understanding, intelligence, sociality, and
personhood. Specifically: statistics do amount to understanding, in any falsifiable sense.
Furthermore, much of what we consider intelligence is inherently dialogic, hence social;
it requires a theory of mind. Complex sequence learning and social interaction may be a
sufficient basis for general intelligence, including theory of mind and consciousness.
Since the interior state of another being can only be understood through interaction, no
objective answer is possible to the question of when an “it” becomes a “who,” but for many
people, neural nets running on computers are likely to cross this threshold in the very
near future.},

They are pretrained foundational models that are self-supervised and can be adapted with fine-tuning to a wide range of natural language tasks, each of which previously would have required a separate network model. This is one step closer to the extraordinary versatility of human language. {GPT}-3 and, more recently, {LaMDA}, both of them {LLMs}, can carry on dialogs with humans on many topics after minimal priming with a few examples. However, there has been a wide range of reactions and debate on whether these {LLMs} understand what they are saying or exhibit signs of intelligence. This high variance is exhibited in three interviews with {LLMs} reaching wildly different conclusions. A new possibility was uncovered that could explain this divergence. What appears to be intelligence in {LLMs} may in fact be a mirror that reflects the intelligence of the interviewer, a remarkable twist that could be considered a reverse Turing test. If so, then by studying interviews, we may be learning more about the intelligence and beliefs of the interviewer than the intelligence of the {LLMs}. As {LLMs} become more capable, they may transform the way we interact with machines and how they interact with each other. Increasingly, {LLMs} are being coupled with sensorimotor devices. {LLMs} can talk the talk, but can they walk the walk? A road map for achieving artificial general autonomy is outlined with seven major improvements inspired by brain systems and how {LLMs} could in turn be used to uncover new insights into brain function.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

The paper examines the general functionality of detection tools for artificial intelligence generated text and evaluates them based on accuracy and error type analysis. Specifically, the study seeks to answer research questions about whether existing detection tools can reliably differentiate between human-written text and {ChatGPT}-generated text, and whether machine translation and content obfuscation techniques affect the detection of {AI}-generated text. The research covers 12 publicly available tools and two commercial systems (Turnitin and {PlagiarismCheck}) that are widely used in the academic setting. The researchers conclude that the available detection tools are neither accurate nor reliable and have a main bias towards classifying the output as human-written rather than detecting {AI}-generated text. Furthermore, content obfuscation techniques significantly worsen the performance of tools. The study makes several significant contributions. First, it summarises up-to-date similar scientific and non-scientific efforts in the field. Second, it presents the result of one of the most comprehensive tests conducted so far, based on a rigorous research methodology, an original document set, and a broad coverage of tools.

Yet, developing intuitive, user-centered methods to effectively explain complex or large amounts of information is still an open research challenge. In this paper we present {ExplanatoryGPT}, an approach we devised and implemented to transform textual documents into interactive, intelligent resources, capable of offering dynamic, personalized explanations. Our approach uses state-of-the-art question-answering technology to generate on-demand, expandable explanations, with the aim of allowing readers to efficiently navigate and comprehend static materials. {ExplanatoryGPT} integrates {ChatGPT}, a state-of-the-art language model, with Achinstein’s philosophical theory of explanations. By combining question generation and answer retrieval algorithms with {ChatGPT}, our method generates interactive, user-centered explanations, while mitigating common issues associated with {ChatGPT}, such as hallucinations and memory shortcomings. To showcase the effectiveness of our Explanatory {AI}, we conducted tests using a variety of sources, including a legal textbook and documentation of some health and financial software. Specifically, we provide several examples that illustrate how {ExplanatoryGPT} excels over {ChatGPT} in generating more precise explanations, accomplished through thoughtful macro-planning of explanation content. Notably, our approach also avoids the need to provide the entire context of the explanation as a prompt to {ChatGPT}, a process that is often not feasible due to common memory constraints.},

	abstract = {Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream {NLP} tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation ({RAG}) – models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce {RAG} models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two {RAG} formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive {NLP} tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain {QA} tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that {RAG} models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

	abstract = {Despite the remarkable ability of large language models ({LMs}) to comprehend and generate language, they have a tendency to hallucinate and create factually inaccurate output. Augmenting {LMs} by retrieving information from external knowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing retrieval-augmented {LMs} employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout the generation process is essential. There have been some past efforts to retrieve information multiple times while generating outputs, which mostly retrieve documents at fixed intervals using the previous context as queries. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active {REtrieval} augmented generation ({FLARE}), a generic retrieval-augmented generation method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test {FLARE} along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets. {FLARE} achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

	abstract = {While recent language models have the ability to take long contexts as input, relatively little is known about how well the language models use longer context. We analyze language model performance on two tasks that require identifying relevant information within their input contexts: multi-document question answering and key-value retrieval. We find that performance is often highest when relevant information occurs at the beginning or end of the input context, and significantly degrades when models must access relevant information in the middle of long contexts. Furthermore, performance substantially decreases as the input context grows longer, even for explicitly long-context models. Our analysis provides a better understanding of how language models use their input context and provides new evaluation protocols for future long-context models.},

	abstract = {Similarity search finds application in specialized database systems handling complex data such as images or videos, which are typically represented by high-dimensional features and require specific indexing structures. This paper tackles the problem of better utilizing {GPUs} for this task. While {GPUs} excel at data-parallel tasks, prior approaches are bottlenecked by algorithms that expose less parallelism, such as k-min selection, or make poor use of the memory hierarchy. We propose a design for k-selection that operates at up to 55\% of theoretical peak performance, enabling a nearest neighbor implementation that is 8.5x faster than prior {GPU} state of the art. We apply it in different similarity search scenarios, by proposing optimized design for brute-force, approximate and compressed-domain search based on product quantization. In all these setups, we outperform the state of the art by large margins. Our implementation enables the construction of a high accuracy k-{NN} graph on 95 million images from the Yfcc100M dataset in 35 minutes, and of a graph connecting 1 billion vectors in less than 12 hours on 4 Maxwell Titan X {GPUs}. We have open-sourced our approach for the sake of comparison and reproducibility.},

We set out to investigate whether {GPT}-3.5 (Codex and {InstructGPT}) can be applied to answer and reason about difficult real-world-based questions. We utilize two multiple-choice medical exam questions ({USMLE} and {MedMCQA}) and a medical reading comprehension dataset ({PubMedQA}). We investigate multiple prompting scenarios: Chain-of-Thought ({CoT}, think step-by-step), zero- and few-shot (prepending the question with question-answer exemplars) and retrieval augmentation (injecting Wikipedia passages into the prompt). For a subset of the {USMLE} questions, a medical expert reviewed and annotated the model's {CoT}. We found that {InstructGPT} can often read, reason and recall expert knowledge. Failure are primarily due to lack of knowledge and reasoning errors and trivial guessing heuristics are observed, e.g.{\textbackslash}textbackslash too often predicting labels A and D on {USMLE}. Sampling and combining many completions overcome some of these limitations. Using 100 samples, Codex 5-shot {CoT} not only gives close to well-calibrated predictive probability but also achieves human-level performances on the three datasets. {USMLE}: 60.2\%, {MedMCQA}: 62.7\% and {PubMedQA}: 78.2\%.},

	abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation across various domains, including medicine. We present a comprehensive evaluation of {GPT}-4 [Ope23], a state-of-the-art {LLM}, on medical competency examinations and benchmark datasets. {GPT}-4 is a general-purpose model that is not specialized for medical problems through training or engineered to solve clinical tasks. Our analysis covers two sets of official practice materials for the United States Medical Licensing Examination ({USMLE}), a three-step examination program used to assess clinical competency and grant licensure in the United States. We also evaluate performance on the {MultiMedQA} suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of test questions containing both text and images on model performance, probe for memorization of content during training, and study calibration of the probabilities, which is of critical importance in high-stakes applications like medicine. Our results show that {GPT}-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on {USMLE} by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models ({GPT}-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-{PaLM}, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-{PaLM} 540B). In addition, {GPT}-4 is significantly better calibrated than {GPT}-3.5, demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the behavior of the model qualitatively by presenting a case study that shows the ability of {GPT}-4 to explain medical reasoning, personalize explanations to students, and interactively craft new counterfactual scenarios around a medical case. Implications of the findings are discussed for potential uses of {GPT}-4 in medical education, assessment, and clinical practice, with appropriate attention to challenges of accuracy and safety.},

	abstract = {{AI} is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., {BERT}, {DALL}-E, {GPT}-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.},

	abstract = {Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model {PaLM}. We trained {PaLM} on 6144 {TPU} v4 chips using Pathways, a new {ML} system which enables highly efficient training across multiple {TPU} Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, {PaLM} 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released {BIG}-bench benchmark. A significant number of {BIG}-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. {PaLM} also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies.},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many {NLP} tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current {NLP} systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train {GPT}-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, {GPT}-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. {GPT}-3 achieves strong performance on many {NLP} datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where {GPT}-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where {GPT}-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that {GPT}-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of {GPT}-3 in general.},

	abstract = {We propose a new test to measure a text model's multitask accuracy. The test covers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, {US} history, computer science, law, and more. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive world knowledge and problem solving ability. We find that while most recent models have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest {GPT}-3 model improves over random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every one of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before they can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance and frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-random accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law. By comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model's academic and professional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many tasks and to identify important shortcomings.},

	abstract = {Information overload is a major obstacle to scientific progress. The explosive growth in scientific literature and data has made it ever harder to discover useful insights in a large mass of information. Today scientific knowledge is accessed through search engines, but they are unable to organize scientific knowledge alone. In this paper we introduce Galactica: a large language model that can store, combine and reason about scientific knowledge. We train on a large scientific corpus of papers, reference material, knowledge bases and many other sources. We outperform existing models on a range of scientific tasks. On technical knowledge probes such as {LaTeX} equations, Galactica outperforms the latest {GPT}-3 by 68.2\% versus 49.0\%. Galactica also performs well on reasoning, outperforming Chinchilla on mathematical {MMLU} by 41.3\% to 35.7\%, and {PaLM} 540B on {MATH} with a score of 20.4\% versus 8.8\%. It also sets a new state-of-the-art on downstream tasks such as {PubMedQA} and {MedMCQA} dev of 77.6\% and 52.9\%. And despite not being trained on a general corpus, Galactica outperforms {BLOOM} and {OPT}-175B on {BIG}-bench. We believe these results demonstrate the potential for language models as a new interface for science. We open source the model for the benefit of the scientific community.},

	shorttitle = {{SelfCheckGPT}},
	abstract = {Generative Large Language Models ({LLMs}) such as {GPT}-3 are capable of generating highly fluent responses to a wide variety of user prompts. However, {LLMs} are known to hallucinate facts and make non-factual statements which can undermine trust in their output. Existing fact-checking approaches either require access to the output probability distribution (which may not be available for systems such as {ChatGPT}) or external databases that are interfaced via separate, often complex, modules. In this work, we propose "{SelfCheckGPT}", a simple sampling-based approach that can be used to fact-check black-box models in a zero-resource fashion, i.e. without an external database. {SelfCheckGPT} leverages the simple idea that if a {LLM} has knowledge of a given concept, sampled responses are likely to be similar and contain consistent facts. However, for hallucinated facts, stochastically sampled responses are likely to diverge and contradict one another. We investigate this approach by using {GPT}-3 to generate passages about individuals from the {WikiBio} dataset, and manually annotate the factuality of the generated passages. We demonstrate that {SelfCheckGPT} can: i) detect non-factual and factual sentences; and ii) rank passages in terms of factuality. We compare our approach to several baselines and show that in sentence hallucination detection, our approach has {AUC}-{PR} scores comparable to or better than grey-box methods, while {SelfCheckGPT} is best at passage factuality assessment.},

	abstract = {Recently, various neural encoder-decoder models pioneered by Seq2Seq framework have been proposed to achieve the goal of generating more abstractive summaries by learning to map input text to output text. At a high level, such neural models can freely generate summaries without any constraint on the words or phrases used. Moreover, their format is closer to human-edited summaries and output is more readable and fluent. However, the neural model's abstraction ability is a double-edged sword. A commonly observed problem with the generated summaries is the distortion or fabrication of factual information in the article. This inconsistency between the original text and the summary has caused various concerns over its applicability, and the previous evaluation methods of text summarization are not suitable for this issue. In response to the above problems, the current research direction is predominantly divided into two categories, one is to design fact-aware evaluation metrics to select outputs without factual inconsistency errors, and the other is to develop new summarization systems towards factual consistency. In this survey, we focus on presenting a comprehensive review of these fact-specific evaluation methods and text summarization models.},

	abstract = {Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream {NLP} tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation ({RAG}) – models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce {RAG} models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two {RAG} formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive {NLP} tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain {QA} tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that {RAG} models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

We empirically study and evaluate several factors that can affect performance on domain language applications, such as the sub-word vocabulary set, model size, pre-training corpus, and domain transfer. We show consistent improvements on benchmarks with our larger {BioMegatron} model trained on a larger domain corpus, contributing to our understanding of domain language model applications. We demonstrate noticeable improvements over the previous state-of-the-art ({SOTA}) on standard biomedical {NLP} benchmarks of named entity recognition, relation extraction, and question answering.

	abstract = {Pretraining large neural language models, such as {BERT}, has led to impressive gains on many natural language processing ({NLP}) tasks. However, most pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web. A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by starting from general-domain language models. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical {NLP} benchmark from publicly-available datasets. Our experiments show that domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of biomedical {NLP} tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board. Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common practices are unnecessary with {BERT} models, such as using complex tagging schemes in named entity recognition ({NER}). To help accelerate research in biomedical {NLP}, we have released our state-of-the-art pretrained and task-specific models for the community, and created a leaderboard featuring our {BLURB} benchmark (short for Biomedical Language Understanding \& Reasoning Benchmark) at https://aka.ms/{BLURB}.},

It has also been demonstrated that the downstream task performance of such models can be improved by pretraining larger models for longer on more data. In this work, we empirically evaluate the extent to which these results extend to tasks in science. We use 14 domain-specific transformer-based models (including {ScholarBERT}, a new 770M-parameter science-focused masked language model pretrained on up to 225B tokens) to evaluate the impact of training data, model size, pretraining and finetuning time on 12 downstream scientific tasks. Interestingly, we find that increasing model sizes, training data, or compute time does not always lead to significant improvements (i.e., {\textbackslash}textgreater1\% F1), if at all, in scientific information extraction tasks and offered possible explanations for the surprising performance differences.},

	abstract = {Recent artificial intelligence ({AI}) systems have reached milestones in "grand challenges" ranging from Go to protein-folding. The capability to retrieve medical knowledge, reason over it, and answer medical questions comparably to physicians has long been viewed as one such grand challenge. Large language models ({LLMs}) have catalyzed significant progress in medical question answering; Med-{PaLM} was the first model to exceed a "passing" score in {US} Medical Licensing Examination ({USMLE}) style questions with a score of 67.2\% on the {MedQA} dataset. However, this and other prior work suggested significant room for improvement, especially when models' answers were compared to clinicians' answers. Here we present Med-{PaLM} 2, which bridges these gaps by leveraging a combination of base {LLM} improvements ({PaLM} 2), medical domain finetuning, and prompting strategies including a novel ensemble refinement approach. Med-{PaLM} 2 scored up to 86.5\% on the {MedQA} dataset, improving upon Med-{PaLM} by over 19\% and setting a new state-of-the-art. We also observed performance approaching or exceeding state-of-the-art across {MedMCQA}, {PubMedQA}, and {MMLU} clinical topics datasets. We performed detailed human evaluations on long-form questions along multiple axes relevant to clinical applications. In pairwise comparative ranking of 1066 consumer medical questions, physicians preferred Med-{PaLM} 2 answers to those produced by physicians on eight of nine axes pertaining to clinical utility (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). We also observed significant improvements compared to Med-{PaLM} on every evaluation axis (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) on newly introduced datasets of 240 long-form "adversarial" questions to probe {LLM} limitations. While further studies are necessary to validate the efficacy of these models in real-world settings, these results highlight rapid progress towards physician-level performance in medical question answering.},

	abstract = {Although large language models ({LLMs}) often produce impressive outputs, it remains unclear how they perform in real-world scenarios requiring strong reasoning skills and expert domain knowledge. We set out to investigate whether {GPT}-3.5 (Codex and {InstructGPT}) can be applied to answer and reason about difficult real-world-based questions. We utilize two multiple-choice medical exam questions ({USMLE} and {MedMCQA}) and a medical reading comprehension dataset ({PubMedQA}). We investigate multiple prompting scenarios: Chain-of-Thought ({CoT}, think step-by-step), zero- and few-shot (prepending the question with question-answer exemplars) and retrieval augmentation (injecting Wikipedia passages into the prompt). For a subset of the {USMLE} questions, a medical expert reviewed and annotated the model's {CoT}. We found that {InstructGPT} can often read, reason and recall expert knowledge. Failure are primarily due to lack of knowledge and reasoning errors and trivial guessing heuristics are observed, e.g.{\textbackslash}textbackslash too often predicting labels A and D on {USMLE}. Sampling and combining many completions overcome some of these limitations. Using 100 samples, Codex 5-shot {CoT} not only gives close to well-calibrated predictive probability but also achieves human-level performances on the three datasets. {USMLE}: 60.2\%, {MedMCQA}: 62.7\% and {PubMedQA}: 78.2\%.},

The explosive growth in scientific literature and data has made it ever harder to discover useful insights in a large mass of information.

In this paper we introduce Galactica: a large language model that can store, combine and reason about scientific knowledge. We train on a large scientific corpus of papers, reference material, knowledge bases and many other sources. We outperform existing models on a range of scientific tasks. On technical knowledge probes such as {LaTeX} equations, Galactica outperforms the latest {GPT}-3 by 68.2\% versus 49.0\%. Galactica also performs well on reasoning, outperforming Chinchilla on mathematical {MMLU} by 41.3\% to 35.7\%, and {PaLM} 540B on {MATH} with a score of 20.4\% versus 8.8\%. It also sets a new state-of-the-art on downstream tasks such as {PubMedQA} and {MedMCQA} dev of 77.6\% and 52.9\%. And despite not being trained on a general corpus, Galactica outperforms {BLOOM} and {OPT}-175B on {BIG}-bench.

Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05221},
	abstract = {We study whether language models can evaluate the validity of their own claims and predict which questions they will be able to answer correctly. We first show that larger models are well-calibrated on diverse multiple choice and true/false questions when they are provided in the right format. Thus we can approach self-evaluation on open-ended sampling tasks by asking models to first propose answers, and then to evaluate the probability "P(True)" that their answers are correct. We find encouraging performance, calibration, and scaling for P(True) on a diverse array of tasks. Performance at self-evaluation further improves when we allow models to consider many of their own samples before predicting the validity of one specific possibility. Next, we investigate whether models can be trained to predict "P({IK})", the probability that "I know" the answer to a question, without reference to any particular proposed answer. Models perform well at predicting P({IK}) and partially generalize across tasks, though they struggle with calibration of P({IK}) on new tasks. The predicted P({IK}) probabilities also increase appropriately in the presence of relevant source materials in the context, and in the presence of hints towards the solution of mathematical word problems. We hope these observations lay the groundwork for training more honest models, and for investigating how honesty generalizes to cases where models are trained on objectives other than the imitation of human writing.},

However, on every one of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before they can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance and frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-random accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law. By comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model's academic and professional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many tasks and to identify important shortcomings.},

	abstract = {Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model {PaLM}. We trained {PaLM} on 6144 {TPU} v4 chips using Pathways, a new {ML} system which enables highly efficient training across multiple {TPU} Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, {PaLM} 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released {BIG}-bench benchmark. A significant number of {BIG}-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. {PaLM} also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies.},

In this paper, we propose a new decoding strategy, self-consistency, to replace the naive greedy decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting. It first samples a diverse set of reasoning paths instead of only taking the greedy one, and then selects the most consistent answer by marginalizing out the sampled reasoning paths. Self-consistency leverages the intuition that a complex reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of thinking leading to its unique correct answer. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that self-consistency boosts the performance of chain-of-thought prompting with a striking margin on a range of popular arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, including {GSM}8K (+17.9\%), {SVAMP} (+11.0\%), {AQuA} (+12.2\%), {StrategyQA} (+6.4\%) and {ARC}-challenge (+3.9\%).},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence ({AI}) researchers have been developing and refining large language models ({LLMs}) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by {OpenAI}, {GPT}-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of {GPT}-4, when it was still in active development by {OpenAI}. We contend that (this early version of) {GPT}-4 is part of a new cohort of {LLMs} (along with {ChatGPT} and Google's {PaLM} for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous {AI} models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, {GPT}-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, {GPT}-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as {ChatGPT}. Given the breadth and depth of {GPT}-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence ({AGI}) system. In our exploration of {GPT}-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of {AGI}, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

	abstract = {An artificial intelligence ({AI})-based conversational large language model ({LLM}) was launched in November 2022 namely, “{ChatGPT}”. Despite the wide array of potential applications of {LLMs} in healthcare education, research and practice, several valid concerns were raised. The current systematic review aimed to investigate the possible utility of {ChatGPT} and to highlight its limitations in healthcare education, research and practice. Using the {PRIMSA} guidelines, a systematic search was conducted to retrieve English records in {PubMed}/{MEDLINE} and Google Scholar under the term “{ChatGPT}”. Eligibility criteria included the published research or preprints of any type that discussed {ChatGPT} in the context of healthcare education, research and practice. A total of 280 records were identified, and following full screening, a total of 60 records were eligible for inclusion. Benefits/applications of {ChatGPT} were cited in 51/60 (85.0\%) records with the most common being the utility in scientific writing followed by benefits in healthcare research (efficient analysis of massive datasets, code generation and rapid concise literature reviews besides utility in drug discovery and development). Benefits in healthcare practice included cost saving, documentation, personalized medicine and improved health literacy. Concerns/possible risks of {ChatGPT} use were expressed in 58/60 (96.7\%) records with the most common being the ethical issues including the risk of bias, plagiarism, copyright issues, transparency issues, legal issues, lack of originality, incorrect responses, limited knowledge, and inaccurate citations. Despite the promising applications of {ChatGPT} which can result in paradigm shifts in healthcare education, research and practice, the embrace of this application should be done with extreme caution. Specific applications of {ChatGPT} in health education include the promising utility in personalized learning tools and shift towards more focus on critical thinking and problem-based learning. In healthcare practice, {ChatGPT} can be valuable for streamlining the workflow and refining personalized medicine. Saving time for the focus on experimental design and enhancing research equity and versatility are the benefits in scientific research. Regarding authorship in scientific articles, as it currently stands, {ChatGPT} does not qualify to be listed as an author unless the {ICMJE}/{COPE} guidelines are revised and amended. An initiative involving all stakeholders involved in healthcare education, research and practice is urgently needed to set a code of ethics and conduct on the responsible practices involving {ChatGPT} among other {LLMs}.},

We examine how (1) scaling up the number of parameters and (2) scaling up the size of the training data could benefit these {NLP} tasks. {GatorTron} models scale up the clinical language model from 110 million to 8.9 billion parameters and improve 5 clinical {NLP} tasks (e.g., 9.6\% and 9.5\% improvement in accuracy for {NLI} and {MQA}), which can be applied to medical {AI} systems to improve healthcare delivery.

As {LLMs} are explored for utility in healthcare, including generating discharge summaries, interpreting medical records and providing medical advice, it is necessary to ensure safeguards around their use in healthcare. Notably, there must be an evaluation process that assesses {LLMs} for their natural language processing performance and their translational value. Complementing this assessment, a governance layer can ensure accountability and public confidence in such models. Such an evaluation framework is discussed and presented in this paper.},

	abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) represent a major advance in artificial intelligence and, in particular, toward the goal of human-like artificial general intelligence. It is sometimes claimed, though, that machine learning is “just statistics,” hence that, in this grander ambition, progress in {AI} is illusory. Here I take the contrary view that {LLMs} have a great deal to teach us about the nature of language, understanding, intelligence, sociality, and personhood. Specifically: statistics do amount to understanding, in any falsifiable sense. Furthermore, much of what we consider intelligence is inherently dialogic, hence social; it requires a theory of mind. Complex sequence learning and social interaction may be a sufficient basis for general intelligence, including theory of mind and consciousness. Since the interior state of another being can only be understood through interaction, no objective answer is possible to the question of when an “it” becomes a “who,” but for many people, neural nets running on computers are likely to cross this threshold in the very near future.},

	abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) have been transformative. They are pretrained foundational models that are self-supervised and can be adapted with fine-tuning to a wide range of natural language tasks, each of which previously would have required a separate network model. This is one step closer to the extraordinary versatility of human language. {GPT}-3 and, more recently, {LaMDA}, both of them {LLMs}, can carry on dialogs with humans on many topics after minimal priming with a few examples. However, there has been a wide range of reactions and debate on whether these {LLMs} understand what they are saying or exhibit signs of intelligence. This high variance is exhibited in three interviews with {LLMs} reaching wildly different conclusions. A new possibility was uncovered that could explain this divergence. What appears to be intelligence in {LLMs} may in fact be a mirror that reflects the intelligence of the interviewer, a remarkable twist that could be considered a reverse Turing test. If so, then by studying interviews, we may be learning more about the intelligence and beliefs of the interviewer than the intelligence of the {LLMs}. As {LLMs} become more capable, they may transform the way we interact with machines and how they interact with each other. Increasingly, {LLMs} are being coupled with sensorimotor devices. {LLMs} can talk the talk, but can they walk the walk? A road map for achieving artificial general autonomy is outlined with seven major improvements inspired by brain systems and how {LLMs} could in turn be used to uncover new insights into brain function.},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, {GPT}-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10\% of test takers. {GPT}-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of {GPT}-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of {GPT}-4.},
