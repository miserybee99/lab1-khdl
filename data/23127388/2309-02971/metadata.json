  "abstract": "Irradiation of solid surfaces with high intensity, ultrashort laser pulses\ntriggers a variety of secondary processes that can lead to the formation of\ntransient and permanent structures over large range of length scales from mm\ndown to the nano-range. One of the most prominent examples are LIPSS - Laser\nInduced Periodic Surface Structures. While LIPSS have been a scientific\nevergreen for of almost 60 years, experimental methods that combine ultrafast\ntemporal with the required nm spatial resolution have become available only\nrecently with the advent of short pulse, short wavelength free electron lasers.\nHere we discuss the current status and future perspectives in this field by\nexploiting the unique possibilities of these 4th-generation light sources to\naddress by time-domain experimental techniques the fundamental LIPSS-question,\nnamely why and how laser-irradiation can initiate the transition of a \"chaotic\"\n(rough) surface from an aperiodic into a periodic structure.",
