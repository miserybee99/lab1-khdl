  "abstract": "We report on the optical characterization of non-magnetic metal/ferromagnetic\n(Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$)/MgO heterostructures and interfaces by using mid\ninfrared spectroscopic ellipsometry at room temperature. We extracted for the\nmid-infrared range the dielectric function of Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$, that\nis lacking in literature, from a multisample analysis. From the optical\nmodelling of the heterostructures we detected and determined the dielectric\ntensor properties of a two-dimensional gas (2DEG) forming at the non-magnetic\nmetal and the CoFeB interface. These properties comprise independent Drude\nparameters for the in-plane and out-of plane tensor components, with the latter\nhaving an epsilon-near-zero frequency within our working spectral range. A\nfeature assigned to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is identified. Furthermore, it is\nfound that both, the interfacial properties, 2DEG Drude parameters and SOC\nstrength, and the apparent dielectric function of the MgO layer depend on the\ntype of the underlying nonmagnetic metal, namely, Pt, W, or Cu. The results\nreported here should be useful in tailoring novel phenomena in such types of\nheterostructures by assessing their optical response noninvasively,\ncomplementing existing characterization tools such as angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy, and those related to electron/spin transport.",
