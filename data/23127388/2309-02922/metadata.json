  "abstract": "$\\underline{\\textbf{MO}}$nte-carlo $\\underline{\\textbf{N}}$ucleon transport\n$\\underline{\\textbf{C}}$ode (MONC) for nucleon transport is extended for below\n20MeV proton transport using ENDF and EXFOR data base. It is used to simulate\np+$^7$Li reaction upto 20MeV proton energies and produced neutron spectra are\nreported here. The simulated results are compared with calculated values from\nother available codes like PINO, EPEN, SimLiT and experimental data. The\nspectra reported here can be used to get the neutron cross-section for the\nquasi-mono-energetic neutron reaction and will help to subtract the low energy\ncontribution. The neutron spectra also useful as this reaction is used for\naccelerator based Boron Neutron Capture Therapy. The backing materials are used\nto fully stop the proton beam hence contribution from the neutrons from backing\nmaterials is estimated. It is found that Tantalum is good backing material\nbelow $\\sim$8 MeV and Carbon is better at higher energies.",
