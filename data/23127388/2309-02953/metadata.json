  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of blended learning in\ncontemporary physics and, more generally, STEM education. In this contribution,\nwe summarize current pedagogical models of blended learning, such as rotational\nand flexible non-rotational models, and customizable configurations of physical\nand virtual learning spaces. With the inevitable integration of digital\ntechnology as one of the pillars of blended learning, teachers find themselves\nin an unprecedented position to not only obtain data more frequently but also\nanalyze it and adjust instruction accordingly. Consequently, we discuss a\ncrucial element of blended learning effectiveness: data management and usage.\nIn this context, data literacy for teaching emerges as an essential skill for\neffective blended learning, encompassing the ability to transform various data\ntypes into actionable instructional knowledge and practices. In other words,\ncurrent research in physics education shows that a data-literate science\nteacher is a more prosperous and effective teacher.",
