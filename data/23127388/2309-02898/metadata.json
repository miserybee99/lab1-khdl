  "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning a function respecting a symmetry from\namong a class of symmetries. We develop a unified framework that enables\nsymmetry discovery across a broad range of subgroups including locally\nsymmetric, dihedral and cyclic subgroups. At the core of the framework is a\nnovel architecture composed of linear, matrix-valued and non-linear functions\nthat expresses functions invariant to these subgroups in a principled manner.\nThe structure of the architecture enables us to leverage multi-armed bandit\nalgorithms and gradient descent to efficiently optimize over the linear and the\nnon-linear functions, respectively, and to infer the symmetry that is\nultimately learnt. We also discuss the necessity of the matrix-valued functions\nin the architecture. Experiments on image-digit sum and polynomial regression\ntasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",
