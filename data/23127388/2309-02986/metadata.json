  "abstract": "High school physics competitions serve as a platform for talented students to\nshowcase their skills, engage in challenging problems, and foster a passion for\nscience. This paper explores innovative approaches to enhance these\ncompetitions by harnessing the power of open science and artificial\nintelligence (AI) tools. Particularly we delve into the capabilities of\nstate-of-the-art AI chatbots, i.e. ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, related to problem\nsolving in physics. Together with open science tools like SageMath and Jupyter\nAI, they have the potential to serve as intelligent, powerful co-pilots,\ntutors, and assistants in understanding and applying physics, as well as\nknowledge from connected STEM fields. Furthermore, these innovative approaches\ncan revolutionize high school physics competitions, providing students and\ntheir tutors with powerful resources to excel in their scientific pursuits.",
