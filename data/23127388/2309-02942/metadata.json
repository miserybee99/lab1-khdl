  "abstract": "Studying Human-Robot Interaction over time can provide insights into what\nreally happens when a robot becomes part of people's everyday lives. \"In the\nWild\" studies inform the design of social robots, such as for the service\nindustry, to enable them to remain engaging and useful beyond the novelty\neffect and initial adoption. This paper presents an \"In the Wild\" experiment\nwhere we explored the evolution of interaction between users and a\nRobo-Barista. We show that perceived trust and prior attitudes are both\nimportant factors associated with the usefulness, adaptability and likeability\nof the Robo-Barista. A combination of interaction features and user attributes\nare used to predict user satisfaction. Qualitative insights illuminated users'\nRobo-Barista experience and contribute to a number of lessons learned for\nfuture long-term studies.",
