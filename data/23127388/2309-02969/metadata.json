  "abstract": "The widespread proliferation of deep learning applications has triggered the\nneed to accelerate them directly in hardware. General Matrix Multiplication\n(GEMM) kernels are elemental deep-learning constructs and they inherently map\nonto Systolic Arrays (SAs). SAs are regular structures that are well-suited for\naccelerating matrix multiplications. Typical SAs use a pipelined array of\nProcessing Elements (PEs), which communicate with local connections and\npre-orchestrated data movements. In this work, we show that the physical layout\nof SAs should be asymmetric to minimize wirelength and improve energy\nefficiency. The floorplan of the SA adjusts better to the asymmetric widths of\nthe horizontal and vertical data buses and their switching activity profiles.\nIt is demonstrated that such physically asymmetric SAs reduce interconnect\npower by 9.1% when executing state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) layers, as compared to SAs of the same size but with a square (i.e.,\nsymmetric) layout. The savings in interconnect power translate, in turn, to\n2.1% overall power savings.",
