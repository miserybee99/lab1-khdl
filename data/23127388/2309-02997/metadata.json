  "abstract": "We explore multi-log grasping using reinforcement learning and virtual visual\nservoing for automated forwarding in a simulated environment. Automation of\nforest processes is a major challenge, and many techniques regarding robot\ncontrol pose different challenges due to the unstructured and harsh outdoor\nenvironment. Grasping multiple logs involves various problems of dynamics and\npath planning, where understanding the interaction between the grapple, logs,\nterrain, and obstacles requires visual information. To address these\nchallenges, we separate image segmentation from crane control and utilise a\nvirtual camera to provide an image stream from reconstructed 3D data. We use\nCartesian control to simplify domain transfer to real-world applications. Since\nlog piles are static, visual servoing using a 3D reconstruction of the pile and\nits surroundings is equivalent to using real camera data until the point of\ngrasping. This relaxes the limits on computational resources and time for the\nchallenge of image segmentation and allows for collecting data in situations\nwhere the log piles are not occluded. The disadvantage is the lack of\ninformation during grasping. We demonstrate that this problem is manageable and\npresent an agent that is 95% successful in picking one or several logs from\nchallenging piles of 2--5 logs.",
