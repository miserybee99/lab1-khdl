  "abstract": "In the context of bottom-up AdS/QCD models, we discuss how the\nconfigurational entropy can describe heavy non-$q\\,\\bar{q}$ states. Using the\nnon-quadratic softwall model, introduced to describe non-linear Regge\ntrajectories, we parametrize different multiquark and exotic meson structures\nto describe $Z_c$, $\\psi$, and $Z_b$ states as non-$q\\,\\bar{q}$ hadrons in\nterms of stability. We found that $Z_c$ is better described as a hybrid meson\nwith one gluon tube, $\\psi$ as hadrocharmonium, and $Z_b$ as hadronic molecule.",
