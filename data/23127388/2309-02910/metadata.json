  "abstract": "Solutions of the target-rapidity Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation are studied\nconsidering, for the first time, the complete impact-parameter dependence,\nincluding the orientation of the dipole with respect to the impact-parameter\nvector. In our previous work, it has been demonstrated that the spurious\nCoulomb tails could be tamed using the collinearly-improved kernel and an\nappropriate initial condition in the projectile-rapidity BK equation.\nIntroducing a different interpretation of the evolution variable, the\ntarget-rapidity formulation of the BK equation brings non-locality in rapidity\nand a kernel modification, removing the term that previously helped to suppress\nthe Coulomb tails. To address this newly emerged non-locality, three different\nprescriptions are explored here to take into account the rapidities preceding\nthe initial condition. Two of these approaches induce mild Coulomb tails, while\nthe other is free from this effect within the studied rapidity range. The range\nis chosen to correspond to that of interest for existing and future\nexperiments. To demonstrate that this set up can be used for phenomenological\nstudies, the obtained solutions are used to compute the F2 structure function\nof the proton and the diffractive photo- and electro-production of J/{\\psi} off\nprotons. The predictions agree well with HERA data, confirming that the\ntarget-rapidity Balitsky-Kovchegov equation with the full impact-parameter\ndependence is a viable tool to study the small Bjorken-x limit of perturbative\nQCD at current facilities like RHIC and LHC as well as in future colliders like\nthe EIC.",
