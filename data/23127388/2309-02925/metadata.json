  "abstract": "The long-time behavior of solutions to the initial value problem for the\nKorteweg-de Vries equation on the whole line, with general initial conditions\nhas been described uniformly using five different asymptotic forms. Four of\nthese asymptotic forms were expected: the quiescent behavior (for |x| very\nlarge), a soliton region (in which the solution behaves as a collection of\nisolated solitary waves), a self-similar region (in which the solution is\ndescribed via a Painlev\\'e transcendent), and a similarity region (where the\nsolution behaves as a simple trigonometric function of the quantities t and\nx/t). A fifth asymptotic form, lying between the self-similar (Painlev\\'e) and\nthe similarity one, has been described in terms of classical elliptic\nfunctions. An integral of elliptic type, giving an explicit representation of\nthe phase, has appeared in this context. The same integral has appeared in the\ntable of integrals by Gradshteyn and Ryzhik. Our goal here is to confirm the\nvalidity of this entry.",
