  "abstract": "Recent advances in dimensionality reduction have achieved more accurate\nlower-dimensional embeddings of high-dimensional data. In addition to\nvisualisation purposes, these embeddings can be used for downstream processing,\nincluding batch effect normalisation, clustering, community detection or\ntrajectory inference. We use the notion of structure preservation at both local\nand global levels to create a deep learning model, based on a variational\nautoencoder (VAE) and the stochastic quartet loss from the SQuadMDS algorithm.\nOur encoder model, called GroupEnc, uses a 'group loss' function to create\nembeddings with less global structure distortion than VAEs do, while keeping\nthe model parametric and the architecture flexible. We validate our approach\nusing publicly available biological single-cell transcriptomic datasets,\nemploying RNX curves for evaluation.",
