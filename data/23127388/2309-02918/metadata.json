  "abstract": "A novel spin texture formed by Cooper pair spins is found theoretically with\na phase string attached by half-quantized vortices at both ends in a unit cell\nand characterized by its topologically rich vortex structure in a spin-triplet\npairing. It is stable at an intermediate field region sandwiched by two\nconventional singular vortex phases below and above it. The d-vector direction\nof this spin texture is tilted from the principal crystal axes, whose spin\nsusceptibility is neither the normal Pauli one \\c{hi}N nor zero, describing\nmicroscopically the process of the d-vector rotation phenomena observed\nrecently in UTe2. We compare the spin texture and singular vortex state in\nrelation to the quasi-particle structure with Majorana zero modes for STM, the\nnuclear spin resonance spectral line width for NMR and {\\mu}SR, and the vortex\nform factors for SANS to facilitate the identification of the pairing symmetry\nin UTe2.",
