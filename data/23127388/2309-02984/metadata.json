  "abstract": "A planar square dot is one of the simplest structures confined to three\ndimensions. Despite its geometrical simplicity, the description of the spin\nwave modes in this structure is not trivial due to the competition of dipolar\nand exchange interactions. An additional factor that makes this description\nchallenging are the boundary conditions depend both on non-local dipolar\ninteractions and local surface parameters such as surface anisotropy. In the\npresented work, we showed how the surface anisotropy applied at the lateral\nfaces of the dot can tune the frequency of fundamental mode in the planar CoFeB\ndot, magnetized in an out-of-plane direction. Moreover, we analyzed the spin\nwave profile of the fundamental mode and the corresponding dynamic stray field.\nWe showed that the asymmetric application of surface anisotropy produces an\nasymmetric profile of dynamic stray field for square dot and can be used to\ntailor inter-dot coupling. The calculations were performed with the use of the\nfinite-element method.",
