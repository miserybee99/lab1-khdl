  "abstract": "We study the wetting model, which considers a random walk constrained to\nremain above a hard wall, but with additional pinning potential for each\ncontact with the wall. This model is known to exhibit a wetting phase\ntransition, from a localized phase (with trajectories pinned to the wall) to a\ndelocalized phase (with unpinned trajectories). As a preamble, we take the\nopportunity to present an overview of the model, collecting and complementing\nwell-known and other folklore results. Then, we investigate a version with\nelevated boundary conditions, which has been studied in various contexts both\nin the physics and the mathematics literature; it can alternatively be seen as\na wetting model in a square well. We complement here existing results, focusing\non the equilibrium properties of the model, for a general underlying random\nwalk (in the domain of attraction of a stable law). First, we compute the free\nenergy and give some properties of the phase diagram; interestingly, we find\nthat, in addition to the wetting transition, a so-called saturation phase\ntransition may occur. Then, in the so-called Cram\\'er's region, we find an\nexact asymptotic equivalent of the partition function, together with a (local)\ncentral limit theorem for the fluctuations of the left-most and right-most\npinned points, jointly with the number of contacts at the bottom of the well.",
