  "abstract": "Energy prediction in buildings plays a crucial role in effective energy\nmanagement. Precise predictions are essential for achieving optimal energy\nconsumption and distribution within the grid. This paper introduces a Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) model designed to forecast building energy consumption\nusing historical energy data, occupancy patterns, and weather conditions. The\nLSTM model provides accurate short, medium, and long-term energy predictions\nfor residential and commercial buildings compared to existing prediction\nmodels. We compare our LSTM model with established prediction methods,\nincluding linear regression, decision trees, and random forest. Encouragingly,\nthe proposed LSTM model emerges as the superior performer across all metrics.\nIt demonstrates exceptional prediction accuracy, boasting the highest R2 score\nof 0.97 and the most favorable mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.007. An\nadditional advantage of our developed model is its capacity to achieve\nefficient energy consumption forecasts even when trained on a limited dataset.\nWe address concerns about overfitting (variance) and underfitting (bias)\nthrough rigorous training and evaluation on real-world data. In summary, our\nresearch contributes to energy prediction by offering a robust LSTM model that\noutperforms alternative methods and operates with remarkable efficiency,\ngeneralizability, and reliability.",
