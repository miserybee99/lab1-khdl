  "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinicopathological syndrome\ncharacterized by hepatic steatosis resulting from the exclusion of alcohol and\nother identifiable liver-damaging factors. It has emerged as a leading cause of\nchronic liver disease worldwide. Currently, the conventional methods for NAFLD\ndetection are expensive and not suitable for users to perform daily\ndiagnostics. To address this issue, this study proposes a non-invasive and\ninterpretable NAFLD diagnostic method, the required user-provided indicators\nare only Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Waist Circumference, Hip Circumference,\nand tongue image. This method involves merging patients' physiological\nindicators with tongue features, which are then input into a fusion network\nnamed SelectorNet. SelectorNet combines attention mechanisms with feature\nselection mechanisms, enabling it to autonomously learn the ability to select\nimportant features. The experimental results show that the proposed method\nachieves an accuracy of 77.22\\% using only non-invasive data, and it also\nprovides compelling interpretability matrices. This study contributes to the\nearly diagnosis of NAFLD and the intelligent advancement of TCM tongue\ndiagnosis. The project mentioned in this paper is currently publicly available.",
