  "abstract": "This paper presents an experimental study showing that the humanoid robot\nNAO, in a condition already validated with regards to its capacity to trigger\nsituational empathy in humans, is able to stimulate the attribution of mental\nstates towards itself. Indeed, results show that participants not only\nexperienced empathy towards NAO, when the robot was afraid of losing its memory\ndue to a malfunction, but they also attributed higher scores to the robot\nemotional intelligence in the Attribution of Mental State Questionnaire, in\ncomparison with the users in the control condition. This result suggests a\npossible correlation between empathy toward the robot and humans' attribution\nof mental states to it.",
