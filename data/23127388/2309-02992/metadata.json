  "abstract": "We study the excitation of a one-electron quantum cyclotron by gravitational\nwaves. The electron in such as a penning trap is prepared to be at the lowest\nLandau level, which has an infinite degeneracy parameterized by the size of the\nwave function. We find that the excitation rate from the ground state to the\nfirst excited state is enhanced by the size of the electron wave function: an\nelectron with a larger wave function feels gravitational waves more. As a\nconsequence, we derive a good sensitivity to gravitational waves at a\nmacroscopic one-electron quantum cyclotron.",
