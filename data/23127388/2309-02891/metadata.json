  "abstract": "We define a very general notion of regularity for functions taking values in\nan alternative real $*$-algebra. Over Clifford numbers, this notion subsumes\nthe well-established notions of monogenic function and slice-monogenic\nfunction. Over quaternions, in addition to subsuming the notions of\nFueter-regular function and of slice-regular function, it gives rise to an\nentirely new theory, which we develop in some detail.",
