  "abstract": "We analyse in detail the QED corrections to the total decay width and the\nmoments of the electron energy spectrum of the inclusive semi-leptonic $B \\to\nX_c e \\nu$ decay. Our calculation includes short-distance electroweak\ncorrections, the complete ${\\cal O}(\\alpha)$ partonic terms and\nleading-logarithmic QED effects up to ${\\cal O}(\\Lambda^3_{\\rm QCD}/m_b^3)$. A\ncomprehensive numerical comparison of our results against those obtained with\nthe Monte Carlo (MC) tool PHOTOS is presented. While the comparison indicates\ngood overall agreement, our computation contains QED effects not included in\nPHOTOS and should therefore better describe photon radiation to $B \\to X_c e\n\\nu$ as measured by the $B$-factories. Our calculations represent the first\nsteps in the construction of a fully differential higher-order QED MC generator\nfor inclusive semi-leptonic $B$ decays.",
