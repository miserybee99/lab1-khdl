  "abstract": "In this work, we numerically construct initial data sets for cosmological\nspace-times with a spatial topology of $\\mathbb{T}^3$, which are generally\ninhomogeneous. To do so, we implement a pseudo-spectral approach based on the\ndiscrete Fourier transform for numerically solving Einstein's constraint\nequations in an algebraic-hyperbolic form. We explore the advantages and\ndisadvantages of this method by comparing the numerical solutions with known\nanalytical initial data sets. Additionally, we perform an stability analysis of\nthe system to gain deeper understanding of the problem. Finally, we numerically\nobtain new families of initial data sets through manipulation of the original\nsystem by imposing restrictions in some of the variables.",
