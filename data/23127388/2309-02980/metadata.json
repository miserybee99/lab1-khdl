  "abstract": "The Ultra Weak Variational Formulation (UWVF) is a special Trefftz\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method, here applied to the time-harmonic Maxwell's\nequations. The method uses superpositions of plane waves to represent solutions\nelement-wise on a finite element mesh. We focus on our parallel UWVF\nimplementation, called ParMax, emphasizing high-order solutions in the presence\nof scatterers with piecewise smooth boundaries. We explain the incorporation of\ncurved surface triangles into the UWVF, necessitating quadrature for system\nmatrix assembly. We also show how to implement a total field and scattered\nfield approach, together with the transmission conditions across an interface\nto handle resistive sheets. We note also that a wide variety of element shapes\ncan be used, that the elements can be large compared to the wavelength of the\nradiation, and that a low memory version is easy to implement (although\ncomputationally costly). Our contributions are illustrated through numerical\nexamples demonstrating the efficiency enhancement achieved by curved elements\nin the UWVF. The method accurately handles resistive screens, as well as\nperfect electric conductor and penetrable scatterers. By employing large curved\nelements and the low memory approach, we successfully simulated X-band\nfrequency scattering from an aircraft. These innovations demonstrate the\npracticality of the UWVF for industrial applications.",
