  "abstract": "In this article we prove several important results on graded rings,\nespecially monoid-rings, that are motivated and inspired by Kaplansky's\nzero-divisor, unit and idempotents conjectures. Among the main results, we\nfirst generalize Kaplansky's zero-divisor conjecture of group-rings $K[G]$\n(with $K$ a field) to the more general setting of $G$-graded rings\n$R=\\bigoplus\\limits_{n\\in G}R_{n}$ with $G$ a torsion-free group. Then we prove\nthat ...",
