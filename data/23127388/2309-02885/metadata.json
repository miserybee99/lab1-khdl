  "abstract": "We consider the stochastic control problem of the shallow lake and continue\nthe work of G. T. Kossioris, Loulakis, and Souganidis (2019) in three\ndirections. First, we generalise the characterisation of the value function as\nthe viscosity solution of a well-posed problem to include more general\nrecycling rates. Then, we prove approximate optimality under bounded controls\nand we establish quantitative estimates. Finally, we implement a convergent and\nstable numerical scheme for the computation of the value function to\ninvestigate properties of the optimally controlled stochastic shallow lake.\nThis approach permits to derive tail asymptotics for the invariant distribution\nand to extend results of Grass, Kiseleva, and Wagener (2015) beyond the small\nnoise limit.",
