  "abstract": "Separable elements in Weyl groups are generalizations of the well-known class\nof separable permutations in symmetric groups. Gaetz and Gao showed that for\nany pair $(X,Y)$ of subsets of the symmetric group $\\mathfrak{S}_n$, the\nmultiplication map $X\\times Y\\rightarrow \\mathfrak{S}_n$ is a splitting (i.e.,\na length-additive bijection) of $\\mathfrak{S}_n$ if and only if $X$ is the\ngeneralized quotient of $Y$ and $Y$ is a principal lower order ideal in the\nright weak order generated by a separable element. They conjectured this result\ncan be extended to all finite Weyl groups. In this paper, we classify all\nseparable and minimal non-separable signed permutations in terms of forbidden\npatterns and confirm the conjecture of Gaetz and Gao for Weyl groups of type\n$B$.",
