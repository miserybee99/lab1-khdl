  "abstract": "Third-party libraries (TPLs) have become an essential component of software,\naccelerating development and reducing maintenance costs. However, breaking\nchanges often occur during the upgrades of TPLs and prevent client programs\nfrom moving forward. Semantic versioning (SemVer) has been applied to\nstandardize the versions of releases according to compatibility, but not all\nreleases follow SemVer compliance. Lots of work focuses on SemVer compliance in\necosystems such as Java and JavaScript beyond Golang (Go for short). Due to the\nlack of tools to detect breaking changes and dataset for Go, developers of TPLs\ndo not know if breaking changes occur and affect client programs, and\ndevelopers of client programs may hesitate to upgrade dependencies in terms of\nbreaking changes.\n  To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study in the\nGo ecosystem to study SemVer compliance in terms of breaking changes and their\nimpact. In detail, we purpose GoSVI (Go Semantic Versioning Insight) to detect\nbreaking changes and analyze their impact by resolving identifiers in client\nprograms and comparing their types with breaking changes. Moreover, we collect\nthe first large-scale Go dataset with a dependency graph from GitHub, including\n124K TPLs and 532K client programs. Based on the dataset, our results show that\n86.3% of library upgrades follow SemVer compliance and 28.6% of no-major\nupgrades introduce breaking changes. Furthermore, the tendency to comply with\nSemVer has improved over time from 63.7% in 2018/09 to 92.2% in 2023/03.\nFinally, we find 33.3% of downstream client programs may be affected by\nbreaking changes. These findings provide developers and users of TPLs with\nvaluable insights to help make decisions related to SemVer.",
