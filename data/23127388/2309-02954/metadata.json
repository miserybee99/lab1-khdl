  "abstract": "Medical image segmentation relies heavily on large-scale deep learning\nmodels, such as UNet-based architectures. However, the real-world utility of\nsuch models is limited by their high computational requirements, which makes\nthem impractical for resource-constrained environments such as primary care\nfacilities and conflict zones. Furthermore, shifts in the imaging domain can\nrender these models ineffective and even compromise patient safety if such\nerrors go undetected. To address these challenges, we propose M3D-NCA, a novel\nmethodology that leverages Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) segmentation for 3D\nmedical images using n-level patchification. Moreover, we exploit the variance\nin M3D-NCA to develop a novel quality metric which can automatically detect\nerrors in the segmentation process of NCAs. M3D-NCA outperforms the two\nmagnitudes larger UNet models in hippocampus and prostate segmentation by 2%\nDice and can be run on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (2GB RAM). This highlights the\npotential of M3D-NCA as an effective and efficient alternative for medical\nimage segmentation in resource-constrained environments.",
