  "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles are exposed to various weather during operation, which is\nlikely to trigger the performance limitations of the perception system, leading\nto the safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) problems. To efficiently\ngenerate data for testing the performance of visual perception algorithms under\nvarious weather conditions, a hierarchical-level rain image generative model,\nrain conditional CycleGAN (RCCycleGAN), is constructed. RCCycleGAN is based on\nthe generative adversarial network (GAN) and can generate images of light,\nmedium, and heavy rain. Different rain intensities are introduced as labels in\nconditional GAN (CGAN). Meanwhile, the model structure is optimized and the\ntraining strategy is adjusted to alleviate the problem of mode collapse. In\naddition, natural rain images of different intensities are collected and\nprocessed for model training and validation. Compared with the two baseline\nmodels, CycleGAN and DerainCycleGAN, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of\nRCCycleGAN on the test dataset is improved by 2.58 dB and 0.74 dB, and the\nstructural similarity (SSIM) is improved by 18% and 8%, respectively. The\nablation experiments are also carried out to validate the effectiveness of the\nmodel tuning.",
