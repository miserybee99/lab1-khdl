  "abstract": "Moir\\'e potential acts as periodic quantum confinement for optically\ngenerated exciton, generating spatially ordered zero-dimensional quantum\nsystem. However, broad emission spectrum arising from inhomogeneity among\nmoir\\'e potential hinders the exploration of the intrinsic properties of\nmoir\\'e exciton. In this study, we have demonstrated a new method to realize\nthe optical observation of quantum coherence and interference of a single\nmoir\\'e exciton in twisted semiconducting heterobilayer beyond the diffraction\nlimit of light. A significant single and sharp photoluminescence peak from a\nsingle moir\\'e exciton has been demonstrated after nano-fabrication. We present\nthe longer duration of quantum coherence of a single moir\\'e exciton, which\nreaches beyond 10 ps and the accelerated decoherence process with elevating\ntemperature and excitation power density. Moreover, the quantum interference\nhas revealed the coupling between moir\\'e excitons in different moir\\'e\npotential minima. The observed quantum coherence and interference of moir\\'e\nexciton will facilitate potential application toward quantum technologies based\non moir\\'e quantum systems.",
