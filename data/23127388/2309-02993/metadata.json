  "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the minimum number of triangles, denoted by\n$t(n,k)$, in $n$-vertex $k$-regular graphs, where $n$ is an odd integer and $k$\nis an even integer. The well-known Andr\\'asfai-Erd\\H{o}s-S\\'os Theorem has\nestablished that $t(n,k)>0$ if $k>\\frac{2n}{5}$. In a striking work, Lo has\nprovided the exact value of $t(n,k)$ for sufficiently large $n$, given that\n$\\frac{2n}{5}+\\frac{12\\sqrt{n}}{5}<k<\\frac{n}{2}$. Here, we bridge the gap\nbetween the aforementioned results by determining the precise value of $t(n,k)$\nin the entire range $\\frac{2n}{5}<k<\\frac{n}{2}$. This confirms a conjecture of\nCambie, de Joannis de Verclos, and Kang for sufficiently large $n$.",
