  "abstract": "Cosmic rays of energies up to a few PeV are believed to be of galactic\norigin, yet individual sources have still not been firmly identified. Due to\ninelastic collisions with the interstellar gas, cosmic-ray nuclei produce a\ndiffuse flux of high-energy gamma-rays and neutrinos. Fermi-LAT has provided\nmaps of galactic gamma-rays at GeV energies which can be produced by both\nhadronic and leptonic processes. Neutrinos, on the other hand, are exclusively\nproduced by the sought-after hadronic processes, yet they can be detected above\nbackgrounds only at hundreds of TeV. Oftentimes, diffuse emission maps are\nextrapolated from GeV to PeV energies, but the sources contributing at either\nenergies likely differ. We have modelled the production of diffuse emission\nfrom GeV through PeV energies in a Monte Carlo approach, taking into\nconsideration the discrete nature of sources. We can generate realisations of\nthe diffuse sky in a matter of seconds, thus allowing for characterising\ncorrelations in direction and energy. At hundreds of TeV, relevant for\nobservations with LHAASO, Tibet AS-gamma, IceCube and the upcoming SWGO,\nvariations between different realisations are sizeable. Specifically, we show\nthat extrapolations of diffuse emission from GeV to PeV energies must fail and\napply our results on the recent experimental findings.",
