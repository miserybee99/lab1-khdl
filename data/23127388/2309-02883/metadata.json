  "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio signals from unknown\ncosmic origin. Many models associate FRBs with high-energy astrophysical\nobjects such as magnetars. In this attempt to find counterparts to FRBs, we\nexplore gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from the Swift and Fermi missions. We first\nsearch for spatial correlations between FRB and GRB populations as a whole and\nthen search for a one-by-one correlation between each of the FRBs and GRBs\ninvestigated. Temporal coincidences are not considered. To evaluate the\nsignificance of any correlation found, we generate background realizations that\ntake into account instrumentally induced anisotropies in the distribution of\nthe sources. Neither study yields any significant counterpart detection. We\nestimate that less than 4\\% of the FRBs are associated with GRBs in the studied\nsamples",
