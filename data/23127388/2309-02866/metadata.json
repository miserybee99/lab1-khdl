  "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy uses light scattering to extract information on low-energy\nexcitations of solids. The Raman process is described by diagrams which are\nfourth order in the light-matter interaction, and in particular the resonant\ncontribution, which involves four different space-time arguments, is difficult\nto evaluate. If one instead simulates explicitly the incoming (classical) light\npulse, the Raman signal is given by the outgoing photon flux and can be\ndetermined from a two-point correlation function. Such a formalism can be used\nto compute the time-resolved Raman spectrum of non-equilibrium systems, as well\nas nonlinear signals which are higher order in the incoming field, such as\nhyper Raman scattering. Here we explain how to implement this time-dependent\nformalism within the dynamical mean field theory framework. The method is\nillustrated with applications to the Holstein-Hubbard model in the strong\nelectron-phonon coupling regime. We demonstrate hyper Raman scattering in\nmeasurements with strong probe fields and frequency mixing signals in the\npresence of a pump field, and simulate the evolution of Stokes and anti-Stokes\nfeatures after photo-excitations of metallic and Mott insulating systems.",
