  "abstract": "This paper uses reconstruction algebras to construct simultaneous resolution\nof determinantal surfaces. The main new difference to the classical case is\nthat, in addition to the quiver of the reconstruction algebra, certain\nnoncommutative relations, namely those of the canonical algebra of Ringel, are\nrequired. All the relations of the reconstruction algebra except the canonical\nrelation are then deformed, and these deformed relations together with\nvariation of the GIT quotient achieve the simultaneous resolution.",
