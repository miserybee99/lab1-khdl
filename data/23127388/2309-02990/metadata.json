  "abstract": "We investigate the number of maximal cliques, i.e., cliques that are not\ncontained in any larger clique, in three network models: Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi\nrandom graphs, inhomogeneous random graphs (also called Chung-Lu graphs), and\ngeometric inhomogeneous random graphs. For sparse and not-too-dense\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs, we give linear and polynomial upper bounds on the\nnumber of maximal cliques. For the dense regime, we give super-polynomial and\neven exponential lower bounds. Although (geometric) inhomogeneous random graphs\nare sparse, we give super-polynomial lower bounds for these models. This comes\nfrom the fact that these graphs have a power-law degree distribution, which\nleads to a dense subgraph in which we find many maximal cliques. These lower\nbounds seem to contradict previous empirical evidence that (geometric)\ninhomogeneous random graphs have only few maximal cliques. We resolve this\ncontradiction by providing experiments indicating that, even for large\nnetworks, the linear lower-order terms dominate, before the super-polynomial\nasymptotic behavior kicks in only for networks of extreme size.",
