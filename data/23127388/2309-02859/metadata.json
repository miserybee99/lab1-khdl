  "abstract": "This paper studies the potential of RIS-integrated NTNs to revolutionize the\nnext-generation connectivity. First, it discusses the fundamentals of RIS\ntechnology. Secondly, it delves into reporting the recent advances in\nRIS-enabled NTNs. Subsequently, it presents a novel framework based on the\ncurrent state-of-the-art for low earth orbit satellites (LEO) communications,\nwherein the signal received at the user terminal traverses both a direct link\nand an RIS link, and the RIS is mounted on a high-altitude platform (HAP)\nsituated within the stratosphere. Finally, the paper concludes by highlighting\nopen challenges and future research directions to revolutionize the realm of\nRIS-integrated NTNs.",
