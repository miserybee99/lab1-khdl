  "abstract": "Localised patterns are often observed in models for dryland vegetation, both\nas peaks of vegetation in a desert state and as gaps within a vegetated state,\nknown as `fairy circles'. Recent results from radial spatial dynamics show that\napproximations of localised patterns with dihedral symmetry emerge from a\nTuring instability in general reaction--diffusion systems, which we apply to\nseveral vegetation models. We present a systematic guide for finding such\npatterns in a given reaction--diffusion model, during which we obtain four key\nquantities that allow us to predict the qualitative properties of our solutions\nwith minimal analysis. We consider four well-established vegetation models and\ncompute their key predictive quantities, observing that models which possess\nsimilar values exhibit qualitatively similar localised patterns; we then\ncomplement our results with numerical simulations of various localised states\nin each model. Here, localised vegetation patches emerge generically from\nTuring instabilities and act as transient states between uniform and patterned\nenvironments, displaying complex dynamics as they evolve over time.",
