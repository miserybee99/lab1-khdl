  "abstract": "This work proposes more solutions for the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in a flat\nFLRW minisuperspace. We study quantum cosmology in the framework of the de\nBroglie-Bohm interpretation and investigate the quantum cosmological effects\nthroughout the evolution of the universe. In a particular solution, the\ntendency for a scalar field to roll down the potential is balanced by the\nquantum force, and a Minkowski spacetime is obtained.",
