  "abstract": "Autonomous navigation in unknown 3D environments is a key issue for\nintelligent transportation, while still being an open problem. Conventionally,\nnavigation risk has been focused on mitigating collisions with obstacles,\nneglecting the varying degrees of harm that collisions can cause. In this\ncontext, we propose a new risk-aware navigation framework, whose purpose is to\ndirectly handle interactions with the environment, including those involving\nminor collisions. We introduce a physically interpretable risk function that\nquantifies the maximum potential energy that the robot wheels absorb as a\nresult of a collision. By considering this physical risk in navigation, our\napproach significantly broadens the spectrum of situations that the robot can\nundertake, such as speed bumps or small road curbs. Using this framework, we\nare able to plan safe trajectories that not only ensure safety but also\nactively address the risks arising from interactions with the environment.",
