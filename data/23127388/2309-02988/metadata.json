  "abstract": "The nonlocality of the fractional operator causes numerical difficulties for\nlong time computation of the time-fractional evolution equations. This paper\ndevelops a high-order fast time-stepping discontinuous Galerkin finite element\nmethod for the time-fractional diffusion equations, which saves storage and\ncomputational time. The optimal error estimate $O(N^{-p-1} + h^{m+1} +\n\\varepsilon N^{r\\alpha})$ of the current time-stepping discontinuous Galerkin\nmethod is rigorous proved, where $N$ denotes the number of time intervals, $p$\nis the degree of polynomial approximation on each time subinterval, $h$ is the\nmaximum space step, $r\\ge1$, $m$ is the order of finite element space, and\n$\\varepsilon>0$ can be arbitrarily small. Numerical simulations verify the\ntheoretical analysis.",
