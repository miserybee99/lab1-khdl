  "abstract": "We study the distribution of sequences of the form $(q_ny)_{n=1}^\\infty$,\nwhere $(q_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$ is some increasing sequence of integers. In\nparticular, we study the Lebesgue measure and find bounds on the Hausdorff\ndimension of the set of points $\\gamma \\in [0,1)$ which are well approximated\nby points in the sequence $(q_ny)_{n=1}^\\infty$. The bounds on Hausdorff\ndimension are valid for almost every $y$ in the support of a measure of\npositive Fourier dimension. When the required rate of approximation is very\ngood or if our sequence is sufficiently rapidly growing, our dimension bounds\nare sharp. If the measure of positive Fourier dimension is itself Lebesgue\nmeasure, our measure bounds are also sharp for a very large class of sequences.\nWe also give an application to inhomogeneous Littlewood type problems.",
