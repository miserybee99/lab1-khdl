  "abstract": "We investigated data embroidery with black-and-white textures, identifying\nchallenges in the use of textures for machine embroidery based on our own\nexperience. Data embroidery, as a method of physically representing data,\noffers a unique way to integrate personal data into one's everyday fabric-based\nobjects. Owing to their monochromatic characteristics, black-and-white textures\npromise to be easy to employ in machine embroidery. We experimented with\ndifferent textured visualizations designed by experts and, in this paper, we\ndetail our workflow and evaluate the performance and suitability of different\ntextures. We then conducted a survey on vegetable preferences within a family\nand created a canvas bag as a case study, featuring the embroidered family data\nto show how embroidered data can be used in practice.",
