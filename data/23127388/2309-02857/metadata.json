  "abstract": "The present article deals with general mechanics in an unconventional manner.\nAt first, Newtonian mechanics for a point particle has been described in\nvectorial picture, considering Cartesian, polar and tangent-normal formulations\nin a unified manner. An extensive differential geometric notions have been used\nwhen motion on curved surfaces has been considered. Both the Lagrangian and the\nHamiltonian formulations have been discussed with various examples. The\nrelevant part of the calculus of variation has been presented in the appendix.\nAlso, a detailed study about the nature of the Lagrangian has been shown in the\nappendix and it has been found that the usual Lagrangian can be extended to\ncurved space-time using the notion of differential geometry. The article may be\nsuitable both for undergraduate and postgraduate students.",
