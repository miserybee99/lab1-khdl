  "abstract": "Recently, we introduced a class of molecular representations for kernel-based\nregression methods -- the spectrum of approximated Hamiltonian matrices\n(SPA$^\\mathrm{H}$M) -- that takes advantage of lightweight one-electron\nHamiltonians traditionally used as an SCF initial guess. The original\nSPA$^\\mathrm{H}$M variant is built from occupied-orbital energies (ie,\neigenvalues) and naturally contains all the information about nuclear charges,\natomic positions, and symmetry requirements. Its advantages were demonstrated\non datasets featuring a wide variation of charge and spin, for which\ntraditional structure-based representations commonly fail.\nSPA$^\\mathrm{H}$M(a,b), as introduced here, expand the eigenvalue\nSPA$^\\mathrm{H}$M into local and transferable representations. They rely upon\none-electron density matrices to build fingerprints from atomic and bond\ndensity overlap contributions inspired from preceding state-of-the-art\nrepresentations. The performance and efficiency of SPA$^\\mathrm{H}$M(a,b) is\nassessed on the predictions for datasets of prototypical organic molecules\n(QM7) of different charges and azoheteroarene dyes in an excited state.\nOverall, both SPA$^\\mathrm{H}$M(a) and SPA$^\\mathrm{H}$M(b) outperform\nstate-of-the-art representations on difficult prediction tasks such as the\natomic properties of charged open-shell species and of $\\pi$-conjugated\nsystems.",
