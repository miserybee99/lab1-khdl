  "abstract": "The models of New General Relativity have recently got attention of research\ncommunity, and there are some works studying their dynamical properties. The\nformal aspects of this investigation have been mostly restricted to the primary\nconstraints in the Hamiltonian analysis. However, it is by far not enough for\ncounting their degrees of freedom or judging whether they are any good and\nviable. In this paper we study linearised equations in vacuum around the\ntrivial Minkowski tetrad. By taking the approach of cosmological perturbation\ntheory we show that the numbers of primary constraints are very easily seen\nwithout any need of genuine Hamiltonian techniques, and give the full count of\nlinearised degrees of freedom in the weak field limit of each and every version\nof New General Relativity without matter.",
