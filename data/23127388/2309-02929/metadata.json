  "abstract": "The online optimization of gasoline blending benefits refinery economies.\nHowever, the nonlinear blending mechanism, the oil property fluctuations, and\nthe blending model mismatch bring difficulties to the optimization. To solve\nthe above issues, this paper proposes a novel online optimization method based\non deep reinforcement learning algorithm (DRL). The Markov decision process\n(MDP) expression are given considering a practical gasoline blending system.\nThen, the environment simulator of gasoline blending process is established\nbased on the MDP expression and the one-year measurement data of a real-world\nrefinery. The soft actor-critic (SAC) DRL algorithm is applied to improve the\nDRL agent policy by using the data obtained from the interaction between DRL\nagent and environment simulator. Compared with a traditional method, the\nproposed method has better economic performance. Meanwhile, it is more robust\nunder property fluctuations and component oil switching. Furthermore, the\nproposed method maintains performance by automatically adapting to system\ndrift.",
