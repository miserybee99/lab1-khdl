  "abstract": "Industry 4.0 has brought to attention the need for a connected, flexible, and\nautonomous production environment. The New Radio (NR)-sidelink, which was\nintroduced by the third-generation partnership project (3GPP) in Release 16,\ncan be particularly helpful for factories that need to facilitate cooperative\nand close-range communication. Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are important\nfor material handling and carriage within these environments, and using\nNR-sidelink communication can further enhance their performance. An efficient\nresource allocation mechanism is required to ensure reliable communication and\navoid interference between AGVs and other wireless systems in the factory using\nNR-sidelink. This work evaluates the 3GPP standardized resource allocation\nalgorithm for NR-sidelink for a use case of cooperative carrying AGVs. We\nsuggest further improvements that are tailored to the quality of service (QoS)\nrequirements of an indoor factory communication scenario with cooperative\nAGVs.The use of NR-sidelink communication has the potential to help meet the\nQoS requirements for different Industry 4.0 use cases. This work can be a\nfoundation for further improvements in NR-sidelink in 3GPP Release 18 and\nbeyond.",
