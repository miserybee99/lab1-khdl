  "abstract": "Heavy ion collisions provide a unique opportunity for studying the properties\nof exotic hadrons with two charm quarks. The production of $T_{cc}^+$ is\nsignificantly enhanced in nuclear collisions compared to proton-proton\ncollisions due to the creation of multiple charm pairs. In this study, we\nemploy the Langevin equation in combination with the Instantaneous Coalescence\nModel (LICM) to investigate the production of $T_{cc}^+$ and $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$\nwhich consists of two charm quarks. We consider $T_{cc}^+$ as molecular states\ncomposed of $D$ and $D^*$ mesons. The Langevin equation is used to calculate\nthe energy loss of charm quarks and $D$ mesons in the hot medium. The\nhadronization process, where charm quarks transform into each $D$ state as\nconstituents of $T_{cc}^+$ production, is described using the coalescence\nmodel. The coalescence probability between $D$ and $D^*$ is determined by the\nWigner function, which encodes the information of the $T_{cc}^+$ wave function.\nOur results show that the $T_{cc}^+$ production varies by approximately one\norder of magnitude when different widths in the Wigner function, representing\ndistinct binding energies of $T_{cc}^+$, are considered. This variation offers\nvaluable insights into the nature of $T_{cc}^+$ through the analysis of its\nwave function. The $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ is treated as a hadronic state produced at\nthe hadronization of the deconfined matter. Its production is also calculated\nas a comparison with the molecular state $T_{cc}^+$.",
