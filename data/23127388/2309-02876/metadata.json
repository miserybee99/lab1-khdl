  "abstract": "Recently, Kirkpatrick et al. [ALT 2019] and Fallat et al. [JMLR 2023]\nintroduced non-clashing teaching and showed it is the most efficient machine\nteaching model satisfying the Goldman-Mathias collusion-avoidance criterion. A\nteaching map $T$ for a concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ assigns a (teaching) set\n$T(C)$ of examples to each concept $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$. A teaching map is\nnon-clashing if no pair of concepts are consistent with the union of their\nteaching sets. The size of a non-clashing teaching map (NCTM) $T$ is the\nmaximum size of a teaching set $T(C)$, $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$. The non-clashing\nteaching dimension NCTD$(\\mathcal{C})$ of $\\mathcal{C}$ is the minimum size of\nan NCTM for $\\mathcal{C}$. NCTM$^+$ and NCTD$^+(\\mathcal{C})$ are defined\nanalogously, except the teacher may only use positive examples.\n  We study NCTMs and NCTM$^+$s for the concept class $\\mathcal{B}(G)$\nconsisting of all balls of a graph $G$. We show that the associated decision\nproblem B-NCTD$^+$ for NCTD$^+$ is NP-complete in split, co-bipartite, and\nbipartite graphs. Surprisingly, we even prove that, unless the ETH fails,\nB-NCTD$^+$ does not admit an algorithm running in time\n$2^{2^{o(\\text{vc})}}\\cdot n^{O(1)}$, nor a kernelization algorithm outputting\na kernel with $2^{o(\\text{vc})}$ vertices, where vc is the vertex cover number\nof $G$. We complement these lower bounds with matching upper bounds. These are\nextremely rare results: it is only the second problem in NP to admit such a\ntight double-exponential lower bound parameterized by vc, and only one of very\nfew problems to admit such an ETH-based conditional lower bound on the number\nof vertices in a kernel. For trees, interval graphs, cycles, and trees of\ncycles, we derive NCTM$^+$s or NCTMs for $\\mathcal{B}(G)$ of size proportional\nto its VC-dimension, and for Gromov-hyperbolic graphs, we design an approximate\nNCTM$^+$ of size 2.",
