  "abstract": "We consider an extension of the classical Total Store Order (TSO) semantics\nby expanding it to turn-based 2-player safety games. During her turn, a player\ncan select any of the communicating processes and perform its next transition.\nWe consider different formulations of the safety game problem depending on\nwhether one player or both of them transfer messages from the process buffers\nto the shared memory. We give the complete decidability picture for all the\npossible alternatives.",
