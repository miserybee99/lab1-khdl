  "abstract": "Firstly, the proposed solution provides remotely accessible integrated IoT\nresources for the safety and security of the building. By using Sha ort\nMessaging System (SMS), the age is sent to the user by the Global System for\nMobile (GSM) system. An SMS alert is sent to the user in case any sensor\ndetects an abnormality in their operation. Secondly, an authentication\nmechanism is deployed to enable only authorized users to access resources.\nThirdly, in case of a malicious approach in accessing IoT resources, a timely\nalert should be received by the owner. A Network Intrusion Detection System\n(NIDS) is deployed to detect and real-time information in case of any\nsuspicious activity while accessing the Internet of Things network.",
