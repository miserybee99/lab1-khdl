  "abstract": "We present solar low-degree rotational splitting values based on a new\nanalysis of Sun-as-a-star observations from the Birmingham Solar Oscillations\nNetwork, covering a 16,425-day period from 1976 December 31--2021 December 20\nwith a duty cycle of 57 per cent. The splitting values are estimated from the\npower spectrum using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling method, and we also\npresent for comparison the results from an analysis of 100 realizations of\nsynthetic data with the same resolution and gap structure. Comparison of the\nscatter in the results from the synthetic realizations with their estimated\nuncertainties suggests that for this data set the formal uncertainty estimates\nare about 30 per cent too small. An upward bias in the splittings at\nfrequencies above 2200 microHz, where the components are not fully resolved, is\nseen in both the observed and synthetic data. When this bias is taken into\naccount our results are consistent with a frequency-independent synodic\nrotational splitting value of 400 nHz.",
