	abstract = 	 {Purely data driven approaches for machine learning present difficulties when data is scarce relative to the complexity of the model or when the model is forced to extrapolate. On the other hand, purely mechanistic approaches  need to identify and specify all the interactions in the problem at hand (which  may not be feasible) and still leave the issue of how to parameterize the system. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach using Gaussian processes and differential equations to combine data driven modeling with a physical model of the system. We show how different, physically-inspired, kernel functions  can be developed through sensible, simple, mechanistic assumptions about the underlying system. The versatility of our approach is illustrated with three case studies from computational biology, motion capture and geostatistics.}

	abstract = "{In this article, a novel strategy to generate broadband earthquake ground motions from the results of 3D physics‐based numerical simulations (PBSs) is presented. Physics‐based simulated ground motions embody a rigorous seismic‐wave propagation model (i.e., including source, path, and site effects), which is however reliable only in the long‐period range (typically above 0.75–1 s), owing to the limitations posed both by computational constraints and by insufficient knowledge of the medium at short wavelengths. To cope with these limitations, the proposed approach makes use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), trained on a set of strong‐motion records, to predict the response spectral ordinates at short periods. The essence of the procedure is, first, to use the trained ANN to estimate the short‐period response spectral ordinates using as input the long‐period ones obtained by the PBS, and, then, to enrich the PBS time histories at short periods by scaling iteratively their Fourier spectrum, with no phase change, until their response spectrum matches the ANN target spectrum. After several validation checks of the accuracy of the ANN predictions, the case study of the 29 May 2012 Mw 6.0 Po Plain earthquake is illustrated as a comprehensive example of application of the proposed procedure. The capability of the proposed approach to reproduce in a realistic way the engineering features of earthquake ground motion, including the peak values and their spatial correlation structure, is successfully proven.}",

Deterministic versions of SSMs (e.g., LSTMs) proved extremely successful in modeling complex time series data. Fully probabilistic SSMs, however, are often found hard to train, even for smaller problems. We propose a novel model formulation and a scalable training algorithm based on doubly stochastic variational inference and Gaussian processes. This combination allows efficient incorporation of latent state temporal correlations, which we found to be key to robust training. The effectiveness of the proposed PR-SSM is evaluated on a set of real-world benchmark datasets in comparison to state-of-the-art probabilistic model learning methods. Scalability and robustness are demonstrated on a high dimensional problem.}

The purpose of this research is to develop a hybrid model or a combination of several forecasting models to predict time series that contain trend, seasonal and calendar variation patterns. This hybrid model is a combination of classical models (namely time series regression and ARIMA model) and/or modern methods (artificial intelligence method, i.e. Artificial Neural Networks). A simulation study was used to show that the proposed procedure for building the hybrid model could work well for forecasting time series with trend, seasonal and calendar variation patterns. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid model is applied for forecasting real data, i.e. monthly data about inflow and outflow of currency at Bank Indonesia. The results show that the hybrid model tend to provide more accurate forecasts than individual forecasting models. Moreover, this result is also in line with the third results of the M3 competition, i.e. the hybrid model on average provides a more accurate forecast than the individual model.}

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

 title={Combining Slow and Fast: Complementary Filtering for Dynamics Learning}, volume={37}, url={https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/25909}, DOI={10.1609/aaai.v37i6.25909}, abstractNote={Modeling an unknown dynamical system is crucial in order to predict the future behavior of the system. A standard approach is training recurrent models on measurement data. While these models typically provide exact short-term predictions, accumulating errors yield deteriorated long-term behavior. In contrast, models with reliable long-term predictions can often be obtained, either by training a robust but less detailed model, or by leveraging physics-based simulations. In both cases, inaccuracies in the models yield a lack of short-time details. Thus, different models with contrastive properties on different time horizons are available. This observation immediately raises the question: Can we obtain predictions that combine the best of both worlds? Inspired by sensor fusion tasks, we interpret the problem in the frequency domain and leverage classical methods from signal processing, in particular complementary filters. This filtering technique combines two signals by applying a high-pass filter to one signal, and low-pass filtering the other. Essentially, the high-pass filter extracts high-frequencies, whereas the low-pass filter extracts low frequencies. Applying this concept to dynamics model learning enables the construction of models that yield accurate long- and short-term predictions. Here, we propose two methods, one being purely learning-based and the other one being a hybrid model that requires an additional physics-based simulator.}, number={6}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Ensinger, Katharina and Ziesche, Sebastian and Rakitsch, Barbara and Tiemann, Michael and Trimpe, Sebastian}, year={2023}, month={Jun.}, pages={7476-7484} }

Observability and integrability existence conditions for the new POCF are weaker than the well-established nonlinear observer canonical form (OCF), which achieves exact error linearization. The proposed observers provide the global asymptotic stability of error dynamics assuming that a global Lipschitz and detectability-like condition holds. Examples illustrate the advantages of the approach relative to the existing nonlinear observer design methods. The advantages of the proposed method include a relatively simple design procedure which can be broadly applied.},

Starting from necessary conditions for the existence of such asymptotic observers, we classify the available methods depending on the detectability/observability assumptions they require. We show how each class of observer relies on transforming the system dynamics in a particular normal form which allows the design of an observer, and how each observability condition guarantees the invertibility of its associated transformation and the convergence of the observer. Finally, some implementation aspects and open problems are briefly discussed.}

Starting from a traditional physics-based model, this is extended by a recurrent neural network and trained using a sophisticated multi-objective strategy yielding physically plausible models. While purely data-driven methods fail to produce satisfying results, experiments conducted on real data reveal substantial accuracy improvements by our approach compared to a physics-based model.}

	abstract = {Physics-based models are often used to study engineering and environmental systems. The ability to model these systems is the key to achieving our future environmental sustainability and improving the quality of human life. This article focuses on simulating lake water temperature, which is critical for understanding the impact of changing climate on aquatic ecosystems and assisting in aquatic resource management decisions. General Lake Model (GLM) is a state-of-the-art physics-based model used for addressing such problems. However, like other physics-based models used for studying scientific and engineering systems, it has several well-known limitations due to simplified representations of the physical processes being modeled or challenges in selecting appropriate parameters. While state-of-the-art machine learning models can sometimes outperform physics-based models given ample amount of training data, they can produce results that are physically inconsistent. This article proposes a physics-guided recurrent neural network model (PGRNN) that combines RNNs and physics-based models to leverage their complementary strengths and improves the modeling of physical processes. Specifically, we show that a PGRNN can improve prediction accuracy over that of physics-based models (by over 20% even with very little training data), while generating outputs consistent with physical laws. An important aspect of our PGRNN approach lies in its ability to incorporate the knowledge encoded in physics-based models. This allows training the PGRNN model using very few true observed data while also ensuring high prediction accuracy. Although we present and evaluate this methodology in the context of modeling the dynamics of temperature in lakes, it is applicable more widely to a range of scientific and engineering disciplines where physics-based (also known as mechanistic) models are used.},

The SRU's architecture is simple, un-gated, and contains a comparable number of parameters to LSTMs; yet, SRUs perform favorably to more sophisticated LSTM and GRU alternatives, often outperforming one or both in various tasks.
