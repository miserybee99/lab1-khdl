\section{Conclusion}
We propose a hybrid modeling scheme that allows to extract hidden information from black-box simulators by informing the latent states of a learning-based model.
To this end, we train a KKL observer that infers OVS latent states via the simulator. 
The OVS states and corresponding predictions are thus constantly controlled by the simulator, preventing them from error accumulation.
Interesting aspects for future work are the extension to the stochastic setting or to different observers and partially observable forms.
