  "abstract": "Dynamics model learning deals with the task of inferring unknown dynamics\nfrom measurement data and predicting the future behavior of the system. A\ntypical approach to address this problem is to train recurrent models. However,\npredictions with these models are often not physically meaningful. Further,\nthey suffer from deteriorated behavior over time due to accumulating errors.\nOften, simulators building on first principles are available being physically\nmeaningful by design. However, modeling simplifications typically cause\ninaccuracies in these models. Consequently, hybrid modeling is an emerging\ntrend that aims to combine the best of both worlds. In this paper, we propose a\nnew approach to hybrid modeling, where we inform the latent states of a learned\nmodel via a black-box simulator. This allows to control the predictions via the\nsimulator preventing them from accumulating errors. This is especially\nchallenging since, in contrast to previous approaches, access to the\nsimulator's latent states is not available. We tackle the task by leveraging\nobservers, a well-known concept from control theory, inferring unknown latent\nstates from observations and dynamics over time. In our learning-based setting,\nwe jointly learn the dynamics and an observer that infers the latent states via\nthe simulator. Thus, the simulator constantly corrects the latent states,\ncompensating for modeling mismatch caused by learning. To maintain flexibility,\nwe train an RNN-based residuum for the latent states that cannot be informed by\nthe simulator.",
