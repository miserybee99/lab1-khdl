  "abstract": "Microacoustic wave devices are essential components in the RF electronics and\nMEMS industry with increasing impact in various sensing and actuation\napplications. Reliable and smart operation of acoustic wave devices at low\ncosts would cause a crucial advancement. Herein, we present the enablement of\ntemperature and mechanical sensing capabilities in a Rayleigh-mode standing\nsurface acoustic wave (sSAW) chip device by harnessing an acoustic shear plate\nwave mode using the same set of electrodes. Most importantly, this mode is\nexcited by switching the polarity of the sSAW transducer electrodes by simple\nelectronics, allowing for direct and inexpensive compatibility with an existing\nsetup. We validated the method in the emergent topic of surface de-icing by\ncontinuously monitoring temperature and water liquid-solid phase changes using\nthe plate wave mode, and on-demand Rayleigh-wave deicing with a negligible\nenergy cost. The flexibility for adapting the system to different scenarios,\nloads and scalability opens the path to impact in lab-on-a-chip, IoT\ntechnology, and sectors requiring autonomous acoustic wave actuators.",
