  "abstract": "We analyze the spectrum of the Neumann-Poincar\\'e (NP) operator for a doubly\nconnected domain lying between two level curves defined by a conformal mapping,\nwhere the inner boundary of the domain is of general shape. The analysis relies\non an infinite-matrix representation of the NP operator involving the Grunsky\ncoefficients of the conformal mapping and an application of the Gershgorin\ncircle theorem. As the thickness of the domain shrinks to zero, the spectrum of\nthe doubly connected domain approaches the interval $[-1/2,1/2]$ in the\nHausdorff distance and the density of eigenvalues approaches that of a thin\ncircular annulus.",
