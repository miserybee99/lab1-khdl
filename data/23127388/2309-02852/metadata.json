  "abstract": "Celtic knots are an ancient art form often attributed to Celtic cultures,\nused to decorate monuments and manuscripts, and to symbolise eternity and\ninterconnectedness. This paper describes the framework CelticGraph to draw\ngraphs as Celtic knots and links. The drawing process raises interesting\ncombinatorial concepts in the theory of circuits in planar graphs. Further,\nCelticGraph uses a novel algorithm to represent edges as B\\'ezier curves,\naiming to show each link as a smooth curve with limited curvature.",
