abstract="The data structure SPQR-tree represents the decomposition of a biconnected graph with respect to its triconnected components. SPQR-trees have been introduced by Di Battista and Tamassia [13] based on ideas by Bienstock and Monma [[9], [10]]. For planar graphs, SPQR-trees have the nice property to represent the set of all its combinatorial embeddings. Therefore, the data structure has mainly (but not only) been used in the area of planar graph algorithms and graph layout.",

In this paper I give several generalizations of the above operations and use Halin's theorem to obtain two variations of Tutte's theorem as well as a classification of 4-connected graphs.}
