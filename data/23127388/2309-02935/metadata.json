  "abstract": "Leakages in drinking water distribution networks pose significant challenges\nto water utilities, leading to infrastructure failure, operational disruptions,\nenvironmental hazards, property damage, and economic losses. The timely\nidentification and accurate localisation of such leakages is paramount for\nutilities to mitigate these unwanted effects. However, implementation of\nalgorithms for leakage detection is limited in practice by requirements of\neither hydraulic models or large amounts of training data. Physics-informed\nmachine learning can utilise hydraulic information thereby circumventing both\nlimitations. In this work, we present a physics-informed machine learning\nalgorithm that analyses pressure data and therefrom estimates unknown irregular\nwater demands via a fully connected neural network, ultimately leveraging the\nBernoulli equation and effectively linearising the leakage detection problem.\nOur algorithm is tested on data from the L-Town benchmark network, and results\nindicate a good capability for estimating most irregular demands, with R2\nlarger than 0.8. Identification results for leakages under the presence of\nirregular demands could be improved by a factor of 5.3 for abrupt leaks and a\nfactor of 3.0 for incipient leaks when compared the results disregarding\nirregular demands.",
