  "abstract": "We consider Hardy operators, i.e., homogeneous Schr\\\"odinger operators\nconsisting of the ordinary or fractional Laplacian in a half-space plus a\npotential, which only depends on the appropriate power of the distance to the\nboundary of the half-space. We compare the scales of homogeneous $L^p$-Sobolev\nspaces generated by these Hardy operators with and without potential with each\nother. To that end, we prove and use new square function estimates for\noperators with slowly decaying heat kernels. Our results hold for all\nadmissible coupling constants in the local case and for repulsive potentials in\nthe fractional case, and extend those obtained recently in $L^2$. They also\ncover attractive potentials in the fractional case, once expected heat kernel\nestimates are available.",
