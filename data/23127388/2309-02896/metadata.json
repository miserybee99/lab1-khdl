  "abstract": "We investigate steady-state current fluctuations in two models of\nrun-and-tumble particles (RTPs) on a ring of $L$ sites, for \\textit{arbitrary}\ntumbling rate $\\gamma=\\tau_p^{-1}$ and density $\\rho$; model I consists of\nstandard hardcore RTPs, while model II is an analytically tractable variant of\nmodel I, called long-ranged lattice gas (LLG). We show that, in the limit of\n$L$ large, the fluctuation of cumulative current $Q_i(T, L)$ across $i$th bond\nin a time interval $T \\gg 1/D$ grows first {\\it subdiffusively} and then {\\it\ndiffusively} (linearly) with $T$, where $D$ is the bulk diffusion coefficient.\nRemarkably, regardless of the model details, the scaled bond-current\nfluctuations $D \\langle Q_i^2(T, L) \\rangle/2 \\chi L \\equiv {\\cal W}(y)$ as a\nfunction of scaled variable $y=DT/L^2$ collapse onto a {\\it universal} scaling\ncurve ${\\cal W}(y)$, where $\\chi(\\rho,\\gamma)$ is the collective particle {\\it\nmobility}. In the limit of small density and tumbling rate $\\rho, \\gamma\n\\rightarrow 0$ with $\\psi=\\rho/\\gamma$ fixed, there exists a scaling law: The\nscaled mobility $\\gamma^{a} \\chi(\\rho, \\gamma)/\\chi^{(0)} \\equiv {\\cal H}\n(\\psi)$ as a function of $\\psi$ collapse onto a scaling curve ${\\cal H}(\\psi)$,\nwhere $a=1$ and $2$ in models I and II, respectively, and $\\chi^{(0)}$ is the\nmobility in the limiting case of symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP). For\nmodel II (LLG), we calculate exactly, within a truncation scheme, both the\nscaling functions, ${\\cal W}(y)$ and ${\\cal H}(\\psi)$. We also calculate\nspatial correlation functions for the current, and compare our theory with\nsimulation results of model I; for both models, the correlation functions decay\nexponentially, with correlation length $\\xi \\sim \\tau_p^{1/2}$ diverging with\npersistence time $\\tau_p \\gg 1$. Overall our theory is in excellent agreement\nwith simulations and complements the findings of Ref. {\\it arXiv:2209.11995}.",
