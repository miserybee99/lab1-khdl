  "abstract": "In this work, we present a problem of simultaneous input-output feedback\nlinearization and decoupling (non-interacting) for mechanical control systems\nwith outputs. We show that the natural requirement of preserving mechanical\nstructure of the system and of transformations imposes supplementary conditions\nwhen compared to the classical solution of the same problem for general control\nsystems. These conditions can be expressed using objects on the configuration\nspace only. We illustrate our results with several examples of mechanical\ncontrol systems.",
