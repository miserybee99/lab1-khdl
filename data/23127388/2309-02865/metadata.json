  "abstract": "We consider the singular numbers of a certain explicit continuous-time Markov\njump process on $\\mathrm{GL}_N(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$, which we argue gives the closest\n$p$-adic analogue of multiplicative Dyson Brownian motion. We do so by\nexplicitly classifying the possible dynamics of singular numbers of processes\non $\\mathrm{GL}_N(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$ satisfying natural properties possessed by\nBrownian motion on $\\mathrm{GL}_N(\\mathbb{C})$. Computing the evolution of\nsingular numbers explicitly, we find that the $N$-tuple of singular numbers in\ndecreasing order evolves as a Poisson jump process on $\\mathbb{Z}^N$, with\nordering enforced by reflection off the walls of the positive type $A$ Weyl\nchamber. This contrasts with -- and provides a $p$-adic analogue to -- the\nbehavior of classical Dyson Brownian motion, where ordering is enforced by\nconditioning to avoid the Weyl chamber walls.",
